{"prompt": "What many companies do when planning their global marketing strategies is to organize the world’s countries into three categories.\nEmerging Markets – Markets regarded as having the most potential for growth (e.g. Huge countries such as China and India) and targeted for long-term investment.\nRest of the World (ROW) Markets – Markets that are often not included in a global marketing strategy because a company does not have sufficient time or resources to pay them any attention.\nA typical company involved in global marketing is likely to have four or five core markets and maybe six to twelve emerging markets.\nIs it Wise to Ignore the ROW?\nCollectively the ROW consists of a huge market of over a billion people. Of course the ROW includes a lot of small countries, but even a country with only five to six million people (e.g. Denmark and Ireland) could be very profitable for the right product. Click here for a list of countries in order of population.\nWhich Languages Does the “Rest of the World” Speak?\nThe Web Globalization Report Card, which tracks the websites of 150 global companies, reports a steadily increasing number of languages supported by global content. As of 2018, the average number of languages supported by all 150 global websites is now thirty-two.\nThe success of global marketing can only be achieved through the use of local languages. If the growth in the number of languages is imagined as a curve, this curve begins quite steeply as companies load up on the core European and Asian languages. After a company reaches the level of twenty languages, the curve starts to taper off. The number of languages supported by a few companies, such as Facebook, Visa, and Dyson has shot up in sudden spikes. However, most companies are only in the early stages of this growth curve.\nIt would be a herculean task to utilize the more than 6,000 languages spoken worldwide, so a global marketing company has to narrow down its language choices to the languages spoken by its core target audiences. The following is a list of ten languages that are shared by leading global websites.\nEnglish – English is the language of globalization and is spoken by over 75% of the world’s population.\nChinese (Simplified) – If people in Chinese speaking markets continue to expand their internet usage, Chinese might one day supplant English as the most widely used internet language.\nArabic – The Arabic language is spoken by 295 million speakers worldwide, and is the official language of 28 different countries. A report from the British Council ranks Arabic as the second most important language of the future.\nSpanish – There are a number of important Spanish speaking countries, not to mention that the Hispanic population in the US will likely double by 2050.\nGerman – The German language is the fourth most spoken language in the world with nearly 210 million speakers worldwide.\nPortuguese – Second behind Spanish in Latin America. Portuguese is spoken by 215 million people in Portugal, Brazil, and some parts of Africa.\nFrench – French is the official language of over 29 countries throughout the world including several of the fastest growing African economies.\nJapanese – Japanese has 130 million native speakers and a similar number of non-native speakers spread out over the world.\nRussian – There are 160 million native speakers in Russia and throughout central and Eastern Europe.\nHindi – Although India is home to 126 million English speakers, around 85% of the population doesn’t speak English well or at all. India represents an enormous growing market.\nIf you are hoping to increase your global marketing reach, it’s essential to expand the number of languages your website or app supports. All countries, including the “rest of the world,” are within your reach. Once you have decided on your target markets, Localize will help you translate your content into the local languages. Talk to us for more information.\nCan you provide a list of the top ten languages that global marketing companies should focus on, according to the leading global websites?"}

However, the disease is also prevalent in Africa, Middle East, South Asia, and pacific descent (Simon, 1999). Moreover, thalassemia causes an immense disruption in the hemoglobin synthesis (Nathan, 1998). Although, there are two different types of thalassemia, alpha, and beta thalassemia they both affect the body.\nAlpha-thalassemia occurs most commonly in people from Southeast Asia and China (Ghosh, 1994). Its is caused when the hemoglobin does not produce enough alpha protein (Ghosh, 1994). The most severe form of alpha thalassemia causes (stillbirth, and death of fetus before delivery) (Ghosh, 1994).\nWhereas, beta thalassemia, is caused by a mutation in the beta globin chain (Nathan, 1998). Genes from both parents must be inherited to acquire the major form of this disease (Simon, 1999). In beta thalassemia major children are normal at birth, but develop anemia during the first year of life (Simon, 1999). The alpha and beta thalassemia's are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Therefore, the symptoms of thalassemia, which are paleness, tiredness, dark urine, and spleen enlargement all, depend on the type and severity of the disease ( Simon, 1999).\nWriteWork contributors. \"Thalassemia\" WriteWork.com.

{"prompt": "Southern Cone Travel: Ice, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nIce, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nAlmost everyone who visits Patagonia looks forward to seeing the great glaciers of Chile’s Fuegian fjords or the massive southern icefields that culminate in Argentina’s Moreno Glacier (pictured below). There are other cool treats that await visitors, though - on their palates, in the form of ice cream (or gelato, if you prefer). Some of it is found in Patagonia itself, but it’s also popular in gateway cities like Buenos Aires.\nMost but not all of those treats are from Argentina, stemming from the Italian tradition that has spread throughout the country. I’d like to recommend a sample of ice creameries and flavors, though I’ll acknowledge a personal prejudice at the beginning: I do not share the adoration for dulce de leche, made from caramelized milk (which Chileans call manjar) that all Argentines and many Chileans drool over. Personally, I find it sickly sweet and, if you choose to try it, don’t say I didn’t warn you. I will not mention it further.\nFor more than three decades, my personal favorite has been Cadore (pictured above) in the Congreso district of downtown Buenos Aires (one of the gateway cities for many a Patagonia itinerary). In the same family since it opened in the 1950s. It’s won awards in Italy itself. The roster of flavors may be less diverse than some more contemporary heladerías, but the quality is extraordinary. My recommendations: chocolate amargo (bittersweet chocolate) and mousse de limón (lemon mousse) are an unbeatable combination.\nIn northern Argentine Patagonia, at the base of the Andes, the town of El Bolsón is the cradle of Helados Jauja (pictured above), which produces many standard flavors but specializes in local fruit flavors, among them the wild calafate berry (according to legend, whoever eats the berry will come back to Patagonia for more). In recent years, this one-of-a-kind ice creamery has opened branches in Buenos Aires and elsewhere, but still produces everything at its home base. My recommendation: calafate con leche de oveja (calafate berries with sheep’s milk) and mate cocido con tres de azúcar (Argentines’ favorite infusion, roughly comparable to green tea, is also popular in parts of Chile).\nMeanwhile, in the Chilean ferry port of Puerto Natales – the gateway to Torres del Paine – Mesita Grande (pictured above) is a pizzeria that takes its name from the single long table that its diners necessarily share. That said, it prepares its own ice cream and, when I offhandedly mentioned Jauja’s calafate flavor, Mesita’s Argentine manager went out of her way to track down berries and sheep’s milk to try to duplicate it. A couple days later, she phoned me to come try it, and the result was a promising experiment that’s not on the regular menu. Still, in its absence, here are my recommendations: chocolate and ruibarbo (rhubarb). There’s also a branch in Punta Arenas, the gateway to the glacial fjords of Tierra del Fuego (pictured below). What is Helados Jauja specializing in and what are some recommended flavors to try at this ice creamery in El Bolsón?"}

{"prompt": "What are the potential obstacles to adopting the Phonebloks concept, including economic and aesthetic factors? Answer according to: We all know that the cycle of electronics consumerism is broken. Because it's an endless money drain for consumers to keep their gadgets current. Because the never ending desire to show off new features leads to bloat and complexity of design. And because all our outdated, abandoned gadgets have to go somewhere. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we Americans threw away 310 million electronic gadgets in 2010 alone. That's about 1.8 million tons of toxic, nonbiodegradable waste in our landfills.\nAt least somebody's expressing concern about this problem—nearly 15 million somebodies, actually. That's how many people have watched a viral YouTube video called Phonebloks, which touts a new phone concept by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens.\nHakkens wants the people of Earth to rise up and demand a new kind of cell phone, in which the various components—camera, processor, GPS, screen—snap together like Legos.\nThis system, he says, would let you build exactly the phone you want. If you keep your files online, you could remove the storage module and replace it with a bigger battery. If you are older, you could unplug the camera and replace it with a bigger speaker.\nAbove all, though, he suggests that the Phonebloks concept would dramatically cut down on e-waste. You wouldn't throw away a phone every other year; instead you'd own just one phone that's built—and rebuilt—to last. If one component broke or became obsolete, you'd just unplug it and replace it with a new one.\nClearly, this concept is consumer catnip. It offers the promise of staying current—without the guilt. And of saving us money and of making it easy for anyone to build a customized phone.\nThere's only one hitch: Phonebloks will never happen.\nThe first problem: physics. Today's smartphone is a miracle of miniaturization. To keep the size small, the speed up and the battery life long, the components are packed in as closely as possible. In Apple's iPhone, for example, the memory, the processor and the graphics circuitry are all built into a single chip. A Phonebloks phone would introduce relatively gigantic distances between these elements, which would kill the battery life, speed and size.\nWhich brings us to the second problem: bulk. Steve Jobs refused to put a removable battery on the iPhone for this reason. A removable battery has to be enclosed in rigid walls so that you, the human, can handle it safely. If every component of your phone were a self-contained, sealed box like that battery, you'd have one very boxy, very bulky, very heavy phone.\nThe third problem: given the limited real estate, today's smartphone engineers sweat over component placement. Where should the antennas go for the best reception? Where does the speaker go for best audio? With free placement of any block on a Phonebloks phone, you would lose enormous advantages of quality, convenience and speed.\nThe fourth problem: economics. The Verizons and AT&Ts of the world love that we throw away our phones every other year; indeed, locking us into new two-year contracts is their business model. Why would they support any movement that would disrupt their herd of cash cows?\nAnd finally: aesthetics. Who would buy the big, boxy, gray, sharp-cornered prototype illustrated in the video?\nYou want to love the Phonebloks concept. You'd love to have more control, greater savings and less guilt. Unfortunately, you'd pay quite a penalty: your phone would be big, heavy, slow, hot, fragile and ugly. Some analysts have even asserted that we would wind up with more electronic waste, a result of consumers discarding more modules more frequently.\nThere is some good news on the discarded-phone front: from all indications, the smartphone is maturing. The improvements in each year's new models are getting less dramatic. These days it's primarily the software that distinguishes your iPhone from your Samsung—and software leaves nothing in landfills.\nEven so, e-waste and obsolescence remain distressing problems. No, Phonebloks is not the solution. But at least it has drawn attention to our current system—and just how broken it is.\nDavid Pogue is the personal-technology columnist for the New York Times and an Emmy Award-winning correspondent for CBS News."}

They told me.\"\nMeanwhile, he said, officials at Florida East Coast Industries, which owns rights of way that are part of the project, has been cooperative, he said.\n\"I’ve had extensive discussions with President Adolfo Henriques and others from Florida East Coast Industries,\" Mr. Winton said. \"The suggestion is that we look at a feasibility analysis to determine the impact of moving as much cargo as we can off the port by rail. We’d have to put the rail line in a tunnel or open trench.\n\"I don’t know what the appropriate vehicle is, and nobody else does right now. It would go (north) to 72nd Street and then go due west.\"\nThe original resolution before the governing board directed staff to develop a plan to finance the unfunded portion project and to identify additional improvements to help fill needs of the port – including rail access and other improvements.\nMr. Winton suggested and the board accepted a modification that added an obligation to commission an independent, objective study funded by the organization on the viability and cost of rail access from Miami to the port by surface or tunnel."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the history and development of the Dumfries and Galloway Carers Centre?\nGenerate according to: The Dumfries and Galloway Carers Centre was established in 1996 following a lot of hard work by a group of Carers and those interested in creating a support organisation for Carers in Dumfries and Galloway. This group became the initial Management Board for the new service. Funded by the local Council, local NHS and funds secured by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers nationally the first two members of staff (including the now Manager, Claudine Brindle) set out to develop the service for, and with, Carers. Work started in a tiny office in Great King Street and then the first Carers Centre on Bank Street opened its doors in February 1997 with the HRH Princess Royal's official opening a year later.\nOver the first five years the organisation worked locally with Carers to provide information, advice and support. The team increased to six staff based throughout Dumfries and Galloway. In response to the first National Strategy for Carers in 1999 and the subsequent Scottish Strategy for Carers in 2000, the Carers Centre worked with local commissioners to include Carers views in the development of the first ever Dumfries and Galloway Carers Strategy. This was launched in 2001 and as a result extra funding was obtained to allow further services to be developed, namely: the Hospital Carers support service; the Young Carers Project; and the Carers Training Project. As a result the staff team quickly doubled.\nIn 2005 the Carers Centre moved to larger premises in Nith Street to offer improved services to Carers - training, groups and wellbeing activities could now be offered on site. This offered Carers access to staff at the same time as attending events. A dedicated Young Carers space was also created ensuring the children and young people had a place to meet.\nAgain the Centre has assisted in the recently launched new Carers Strategy which will see new and existing services developed in response to the needs of Carers locally. Over 7000 individual Carers have registered since inception with an average of 450 new Carers registering each year. All are provided with a quality service that aims to improve the outcomes for Carers living in Dumfries and Galloway."}

{"prompt": "As I’ve said again and again – Science is everywhere! It’s in the air we breathe, the body we move around in, the nature around us, and the food we eat. It’s even in the sweet treats we enjoy. Yes, Peeps science is a thing. One of our kids’ (and maybe my) favorite things to do with Peeps candy at Easter is put them in the microwave and watch them expand. If you remove them from the microwave before they explode or catch fire, (note: Remove the Peeps before this happens. This can ruin your microwave.) the puffy Peep collapses into a flattened mass of goo. If you plan on eating it, do it fast before it cools and hardens. So what makes the Peep puff up in the microwave and then collapse as it cools? Peeps are made mostly of sugar, water, and gelatin. This mixture is heated and whipped to add air bubbles. This creates the light, fluffy texture of Peeps. As this mixture cools, the gelatin and air bubbles helps the Peeps hold their shape and not flatten. When we heat a Peep in the microwave, the air molecules in the bubbles inside the Peep start moving faster. As the molecules start moving faster, the pressure inside the bubbles begins to increase and push on the walls of the bubbles. The heat of the microwave is, also, starting to cause the sugar in the Peep to soften. So, when as the air molecules push on the sides of the bubbles inside the peep, the bubbles to expand and grow. This is what causes Peeps to get bigger when heated in the microwave. My kids are always disappointed when we take the puffed up Peep from the microwave only to see it instantly deflate. Once the heating stops, the air molecules slow down and stop pushing against the wall of the bubbles and some bubbles burst letting the air out of the Peep. This, plus the fact that some of the water in the Peep evaporates during heating lead to the collapse of the Peep. One day after looking at our deflated Peeps, we talked about the changes that took place in the Peeps do to heating. We thought about the air escaping and the water evaporating and wondered if this caused a change in mass, or weight. Well, there is only one way to find out. Design an experiment! Weigh your glass bowl. If your scale has a tare feature, use it now. If not, record the weight of the bowl. Next, add a Peep to the bowl and record the weight of the Peep. If you do not have a tare feature on your scale, you will have to subtract the weight of the bowl from the weight of the bowl and the Peep to find the weight of the Peep alone. Place the Peep and the bowl in the microwave. Heat for 30 seconds. Immediately after the microwave shuts off, take the bowl and Peep out of the microwave and weigh it. Record the weight of the Peep. Again, subtract the weight of the bowl if you did not use the tare feature. Continue this procedure with new Peeps each time increasing the time by 10 seconds until you have reached 60 seconds. Each time you repeat the experiment, it is called a trial. Record the before and after weights, along with the time for each trial. When all the trials are completed. Subtract the ending weights of each trial from the beginning weights. This is the mass or weight lost in each trial. Graph the amounts of weight lost against the time each Peep was heated. What does the graph look like? Discuss and explain your results. We always have way more peeps than we need to eat so this experiment will be a fun way to use up the extra peeps! Is it possible to do this in an oven? We don’t have a microwave. That would be a great experiment – just to see if this works! Try it out and let me know how it goes. Can you explain why Peeps expand in the microwave and then collapse as they cool?"}

{"prompt": "How can insurance help keep your bike secure, especially with high rates of theft in the UK? Can you recommend any insurance providers?\nGenerate according to: Greener, leaner and once you make the initial investment it could save you a fortune in travelling costs – more and more of us are waking up to the life-changing benefits of cycling, whether it’s for commuting, leisure or sport.\nCycling is on the rise, particularly as it’s getting a little warmer. If it’s something you’re interested in, it’s time to start thinking about what you need to get the most out of your bike. Having taken up cycling properly over the last year or so, and trained to become a Breeze Champion with British Cycling, I hope I have learned enough to help you get into cycling too.\nThis may seem a little obvious, but there are still people out there who are cycling without a helmet! Study after study has shown that wearing a helmet reduces the risk of fatalities and injuries for all cyclists. Even minor falls can have potentially disastrous consequences if you hit your head. Remember, your brain is the only part of your body that can’t repair itself, so be smart and protect it.\nKnowing how to do basic maintenance is a must for all cyclists. Nothing can ruin a ride faster than a flat tire, crooked stem, or a loose seatpost. Invest in some basic, quality tools, and maintenance becomes a whole lot easier.\nWe’re all familiar with sunburn, but the sun can damage your eyes, too. It’s also important that the sun doesn’t restrict one’s vision, especially if driving on road. For mountain bikers, there’s also the danger of sticks, rocks and mud getting into your eye, which can cause more serious injuries. Most cycling sunglasses today are designed to protect your eyes with UV blocking treatments.\nWhen you ride you will burn a huge amount of calories. If you’ll be riding more than 90 minutes, you should take snacks and water en route.\nA great pair of cycling shorts will be a life changing investment on your cycling journey. A good pair will include a chamois pad sewn in that offers plenty of cushion and support that will work with your saddle to keep you comfortable. The lycra material most shorts are made from also is highly breathable, wicks away sweat and is designed to minimize rubbing and chaffing.\nHaving spent hundreds on a bike and gear, have you thought about insurance? Sometimes locking up your bike just isn’t enough. Last year approximately 448,000 bicycles were stolen in the UK, while research earlier this year shows that one bike is stolen every minute in the UK. That’s pretty scary. If you’d like to get a quote for insurance on your bike, you can cover it with your home contents with Urban Jungle – their quote journey only takes a few minutes from start to finish and will leave you feeling secure about your bike. With a unique contents calculator you can use to see what insurance would suit you best.\nA good jacket can help save your ride, especially in transitional seasons like spring. For the upcoming season you should go for a model that is windproof, water-resistant, and can pack up small enough to fit into a jersey pocket.\nChoosing the right cycling shoes is one of the most important decisions you can make. A bad fitting pair of shoes can turn what should have been a pleasant bike ride into hours of agony. The right pair of shoes aren’t the ones that look the coolest, they’re the ones that fit your feet the best.\nCycling gloves soak up that sweat, keeping your hands dry and allow you to maintain a safe grip on the handlebars at all times. Gloves can have padded palms, providing extra comfort by cushioning your hands from the vibrations passed through the bike and handlebar to the main contact points.\nIf you’re considering cycling as a way to get fit for summer, use this list to make sure you stay safe and comfortable. If you have the essentials, you’ll have no excuses!\nWell I needed this read, just about to get my bike out of the storage and haven’t used it for last two years!\nI LOVE cycling ! Unfortunately my bike got stolen a few years back and I haven’t had the money to buy a new one, let alone all the little extras you need in your kit.\nThese are great tips. I’ve been thinking about getting a bike to get around London so this is really helpful!\nI haven’t ridden a bike for so long, but these are some very useful tips!"}

Thomas Oliveras both pleaded guilty Monday to disturbing the peace during a hearing in Orange County Superior Court as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. They each agreed to pay $500 to an emergency fund for crime victims but will not serve jail time or be placed on probation, according to court records.\nIn exchange for Hendricks’ guilty plea, two counts of battery on emergency workers and a count of resisting arrest were dismissed.

Oliveras originally faced a maximum of two years in jail, if convicted as charged.\nBoth men can go through a legal process to get the convictions expunged at some point, defense attorney John Barnett said.\nThe men were off-duty and attending a Lady Antebellum concert in Irvine with their spouses on Aug. 24, 2018, when the chief’s wife needed medical attention. When EMTs responded to assess her condition, authorities alleged at the time that Hendricks pushed two EMTs as they tried to provide treatment.

This means that ads can be tweaked and further ads tested during the campaign, to maximise conversion rates and drive down the cost per click.\nEven though you might not receive a click every time your ad is shown, there’s still a good chance that the search traffic saw your ad. The more you can appear across search, whether it be in organic or paid listings, then the more you are increasing your brand exposure. If people can recognise and remember your brand, then there is more chance of them looking you up, should they require your product or service at another time.\nYou can also have your pay per click ads show up to an audience who have already shown an interest in you, your product or service, as they visit other websites. For example, Google can target visitors to your website that haven’t completed a purchase or even audiences that have watched your video or read your blog post.\nThis way, you can reach real, potential customers through ads and encourage them to make a conversion, such as complete their purchase, buy other products from you or sign up to your newsletter.\nThis entry was posted in PPC and tagged paid search advertising, paid search marketing, pay per click, pay per click advertising, pay per click advertising benefits, PPC advertising, search engine marketing, the benefits of pay per click advertising on December 27, 2013 by Pinnacle.\nGo ahead!

Answer according to: It all started with a little problem….When my little 2 year old daughter was turning three, all she wanted was a beautiful sterling silver bracelet just like her mamas. So I thought this would be really easy to find. Oh, how little did I know!\nI searched for hours and days on end across shopping centres and boutiques to try and find a quality, affordable and trendy piece of kid's sterling silver, then looked online and couldn’t find anything that was suitable for a small little girl, but came out empty-handed.\nThus began my journey to design and produce beautiful, luxurious sterling silver jewellery necklaces and bracelets, sized JUST for kids and tweens, and in a way that THEY can design, personalise and interchange their own designs. Also, I am very strict with the quality control, and create each piece so that it is durable and strong.\nAs a very practical Mother, (raising two little ones on my own), I wanted the children's jewellery to be high quality and affordable, but also grow with children. So, I made each piece fully adjustable to grow with children. I use lead free and nickel free premium .925 sterling silver and heavy 18 karat gold plating on our rose gold and yellow gold pieces, so the children's jewellery is built to last.\nWe hope your girls LOVE wearing the My Little Silver jewellery as much as I enjoyed designing them!"}

{"prompt": "What are some examples of subject lines used by retailers that effectively affirm the benefit of clicking and viewing the email? Answer according to: Facing criticism, Presidential campaigners employ better email marketing techniques, but their emails are still not what everyone wants to read. Just another email to skip over–that’s what Presidential campaign emails invoke in the minds of consumers and potential voters. And as the latest emails from Hilary Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain will likely not be read, they can’t be doing any good for democracy.\nWhile their recent actions have succeeded in improving the effectiveness of the sign-up process and email wording, campaigners have not fully tackled the motivational factor that is essential in successfully using email marketing services – a problem easily solved by examining techniques from the business community when constructing emails.\nWhat’s in it for me? Obama and Hillary’s most recent campaigns are ambiguous about this issue. The latest email message from Bill Clinton includes subject line: “Not big on quitting.” No subject is apparent in the line. Who is not big on quitting? Hillary? Bill? The email team? The supporters? Next, take the latest message from the Obama team: “What’s next.” Again there is no subject, nor is there an action in this line. Open the email and find the first appeals to action; “contribute by our midnight Monday deadline” and “check out these resources” by Bill Clinton and Obama, respectively.\nCompare Obama’s and Clinton’s email marketing campaigns to that of an email marketing campaign from a market-leading retailer. Subject lines like “Tee Time: Buy 2 Save 20%” and “All The Dresses You Need For Spring” clearly affirm the benefit of clicking and viewing the email before email readers have seen any content. The first line employs two key verbs, “buy” and “save,” while the second line directly accosts the reader. A simple revision of the subject lines with a seller-buyer framework could deliver: “Deadline Ahead: Don’t Quit, Act Now” and “Everything You Should Know about Obama.” These subject lines create a sense of urgency and shift the locus of power from the sender to the recipients of the emails.\nFar from victorious on the subject lines front, Hillary’s camp has made significant changes in the body of their emails. In an attempt to generate easy-to-read, visually arresting messages, they utilize bold font every few lines to highlight main ideas in the paragraphs. They also showcase a bold-colored countdown clock with a yellow “Contribute Now” button link. Similarly, Obama’s email highlights information by categorizing it under 3 headings (The Basics, Organizing, and Fundraising).\nLamentably, emails from both sides lack visuals. Obama and Hillary rarely include photos in their emails, and McCain includes just a few small photos in his email banner. In contrast, retailers, internet providers and pizza joints alike have been utilizing large picture links to attract consumers. The picture link is standard practice today. Democratic nominees recognize that they need to modify their marketing strategy, however, and have started using email marketing software to offer campaign contributors sweepstakes prizes, such as a private meeting with Obama or Clinton. Unfortunately, these offers can be hard to find. For example, Obama sent an email with the subject “Deadline,” but the email described a drawing to win a dinner with Barack Obama himself, which was listed towards the bottom of the email.\nObama’s use of contribution incentives in his email marketing campaigns could explain why his email program ranks third on Email Data Source’s 2008 Email Brand Equity Ranking while McCain, who does not use such tactics, is not among the top 5 of that list. Other reasons may include the perceived lack of exigency in the emails or the news-like headlines in McCain’s subject lines.\nFour years ago, pundits, bloggers and the general public declared that the Presidential campaigns lagged far behind the business, technology, and entertainment sectors in internet marketing practices. In this election, Presidential hopefuls have succeeded in closing the gap in the email race, but have not yet achieved parity."}

{"prompt": "How long does it take for the vanilla extract to be ready to use?\nGenerate according to: Somehow vanilla has become synonymous with boring and bland. When, in fact, it is anything but. Vanilla is rich, exotic, fragrant, and quite expensive! It imparts a unique flavor and aroma into anything you add it to. I almost never bake without it. If you go through vanilla extract anywhere near the rate I do, I highly suggest trying your hand at making it yourself.\nPersonally, vanilla is my absolute favorite scent. I have several perfumes, lotions, and candles that all smell like vanilla. It’s such a comforting and delicious smell. And I love using vanilla in the kitchen even more. Homemade vanilla extract adds a special touch to baked goods and desserts. I’ll show you how to make vanilla extract so that you can have the best possible vanilla flavor for your treats!\nMaking vanilla extract is such a simple process! It requires two ingredients and a bottle with a tight-fitting lid. That’s it! You have some choices in types of vanilla beans and alcohol. In the picture, I’ve used Madagascar Bourbon vanilla beans on the left and Tahitian vanilla beans on the right. There are slight differences in flavor, scent, and size depending on the variety and quality. As for the alcohol, I prefer using vodka since it’s neutral taste doesn’t compete with the vanilla. No need to use an expensive brand here.\nI’ve given quite a large range in the amount of vanilla beans because I’ve found that they vary so much in size. Four large vanilla beans may be about equivalent to eight smaller vanilla beans. Use your judgement depending on the size of vanilla beans you have.\nWhen you use your homemade vanilla extract, you’ll find that you get some of the little vanilla bean flecks along with it. I love the visual appeal, but feel free to strain them out if you prefer.\nThe process to make vanilla extract is really simple. Fill a glass jar or bottle with vodka. Split your vanilla beans, leaving them connected at the ends, if you’d like. I often scrape out the vanilla beans inside to add to the vodka, but that step isn’t necessary. Add your vanilla beans, close the lid tightly, and shake! Make sure to store it out of direct light or heat, and shake every day or two. That’s it!\n2-ingredient DIY vanilla extract that is perfect for baking and adding a special vanilla flavor to so many recipes!\nSplit vanilla beans in half lengthwise with a sharp knife.\nAdd vanilla beans to a glass bottle or jar that has a tight-fitting lid.\nCover with vodka, close the lid tightly, and shake vigorously for a few seconds.\nStore the extract in a cool, dark place. Shake every day or two.\nAfter about 4-6 weeks, it's ready to use!\nLeave vanilla beans in the extract past the initial month or two to continue to infuse flavor. You may also remove them to use in another recipe, if desired."}

Go watch “Stupid Kitchen Tools” for a good sample-rant. But he’s always put a lot of thought into his opinions, so when he launched a line of kitchen tools I was pretty sure they wouldn’t, you know, be stupid. A few I’m interested in.\nOffset spoon set – No more tasting spoons sliding into the bowl. Brilliant.\nPerforated egg spoon – I have one of these that works well enough but the handle is way too long in my opinion and the bowl itself too shallow. Ruhlman’s got the right idea here.\nThe Kitchen Tool Bundle includes those, a set of (non-stupid) wooden paddles. See also: bamboo pot scrubbers, offset soup spoons and more at his full products website.\nAll-Clad 8” pan – I have and love my 12″ All-Clad pan – which is just a complete, all-around workhorse – but something smaller for omelets, lunch leftovers, etc. Would be great. This’d be my pick.\nDemeyere 3.5 qt. Saucier pan – This is a pricey dude, and they don’t seem to have the more bare-bones version I bought 10+ years ago for sale anymore, but I use this weekly and if you can afford it, I think you will too.

{"prompt": "Given the text: It’s always been true that you need your marketing to reach the right people. But today’s digital marketing gives you an ability to structure personalised marketing campaigns that will make your prospects really feel your love – and be more inclined to become a customer, and even one of your champions.\nOver the past few years it has become a lot easier to find your customer through various channels online. Because of this, companies can interact with their target audience much more frequently and efficiently. Instead of the days of old when you might buy ad space in the newspaper or send out thousands of leaflets to random households, praying you would find leads, you can now narrow down your searches and pick out people to target.\nSearch for and follow people who are most likely to purchase your product. If you offer stationary supplies, try searching for businesses and schools.\nOver time companies are likely to follow back, which is when you can start attracting them to your brand.\nCreate a few blogs on why your product or service is important to businesses and how you are offering the best in the field; this will give them a reason to buy from you over your competitor.\nRemember, this method isn’t instantaneous and your content needs time to spread. That’s why it’s important to keep promoting it across social media.\nAnd finally, once you have built up a customer base, remember to keep them loyal. Send them quick updates on new products or retweet them every now and then. This is more likely to make them feel appreciated and therefore promote your brand as well.\nThe more your potential customer feels like they are valued by you, the more likely they are to actually want to help your business grow. It’s about creating a reason for them to be loyal to you over your competition. It’s very much like the snowball effect, the more customers are supportive of your brand, the more they will spread the word of your brand. This in turn attracts new customers who do the same.\nSo, in the future, tailor your content to specific individuals and keep them interested, giving them the opportunity to bring more customers to your business.\nWhat are some ways to build up a loyal customer base and retain them over time?"}

{"prompt": "Woodcarver Joe Pilkenton shares his stories with audience at the BCHT event.\nPeople have forgotten history,” Joe Pilkenton said as he began his presentation to the Boones Creek Historical Trust during their March meeting at the Boones Creek Christian Church Chapel. The sculptor and woodcarver of figures of Daniel Boone set up an artist’s display to illustrate to the 40 people present the meaning of his statement.\nToday, Pilkenton said, “I still act if I was a child. Now I teach carving to both children and adults.” He started his present carving at night after a day filled with graphic design. “I was tired,” he said “and it was a release from the stress of the day.\nDescribing himself as a “self-taught sculptor, wood carver, illustrator, painter and semi-retired creative director in a Field of Dreams,” he is the owner of Painted Horse Studio in Kingsport. The studio has been his place of business some 40 years – 1979 to the present day.\nHis projects have included work on the Kingsport Carousel, a community project that includes 32 wooden riding animals and two chariots, 24 founding boards depicting notable sites within the city and 24 hand-carved “sweep” animals around the top. Each animal took 800 to 1,000 hours to carve and paint.\nPilkenton carved a white buffalo for the Carousel that weighed 760 pounds. “I’d never done anything this size,” he said. He also carved a pinto that is the lead horse of the carousel.\nHe donated a Boone sculptor to Kingsport that is 14 to 15 feet long with a water feature.\nThe March Historic Trust Meeting featured the “First Homemade Chili Supper” with seven different soups. An upcoming event of the organization is their 2019 Fundraiser, a Barbeque Supper on May 10 from 4 – 8 p.m. At the Boones Creek Christian Church.\nFor details about the Trust and the Dinner, telephone (423) 461-0151.

Were there any significant changes observed in these measures after the program?\nGenerate according to: Citation: Hillier, A.J., Fish, T., Siegel, J.H., & Beversdorf, D.Q. (2011). Social and vocational skills training reduces self-reported anxiety and depression among young adults on the autism spectrum. The Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities, 23 (3), 267-276.\nAuthors: Hillier, A.J., Fish, T., Siegel, J.H., & Beversdorf, D.Q.\nBackground: People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently experience high levels of anxiety and depression. These psychological factors might be related to some of the core challenges seen among those with ASD, including social difficulties. Few previous studies have examined the broader outcomes for social skills interventions, such as a reduction in anxiety and depression, despite the prevalence of these comorbid conditions among those with ASD.\nPurpose: The purpose of paper is to report on a social and vocational skills program specifically designed to address the needs of adolescents and young adults with ASD.\nIntervention: Participants received the Aspirations program, which consisted of eight one-hour weekly meetings with small groups of between five to seven participants. The program was designed to improve social and vocational skills. During the program, participants sat in a semi-circle to facilitate discussion. Group members learned and gained greater understanding by sharing personal experiences and listening to those of others, by giving each other advice, and by creating problem solving strategies as a group.\nData collection and analysis: Participants were asked to complete questionnaires 2-3 weeks before and at the end of their participation in the Aspirations program. Questionnaires included a measure of depression which questioned participants’ feelings of sadness, pessimism, guilt etc. Specific assessment used are: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory-II; Peer Relations Index. Data was analyzed non-parametrically due to the type of data (Wilcoxon signed ranks test), and hypotheses were two-tailed.\nFindings: The findings indicate that participants reported significantly reduced anxiety after their participation in the Aspirations program compared to before with lower scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Participants also reported significantly reduced depression after participating in our program compared to before with lower scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Responses on the Peer Relations Index (Hudson 1992) were higher post- Aspirations compared to pre-Aspirations indicating improvement in attitudes and feelings toward peers, although this did not reach significance.\nConclusions: To conclude, following the intervention program participants reported significantly lower depression and anxiety. Responses on a measure of peer relationships were also improved post-intervention, although this did not reach significance. Although preliminary, the findings demonstrate the broader, positive impact that such programs may have."}

{"prompt": "What are the challenges facing mobile advertising, according to the author, and why does it make him worry about the future of advertising in this medium? Generate according to: Recently, I spent a few days on the West Coast visiting some VCs, tech companies that look like media companies, and startups. I spent an amazing day at Y Combinator’s Demo Day, which is always a highlight and really inspiring. It’s fantastic to watch people who truly believe they have a business that will change the world present their ideas. I’m also sure that some of those businesses will go on to truly make a difference. Many of the businesses we met have a mobile core. A lot of them make apps providing a subscription service, some manage and analyze big data, and others are designed to improve our health care system. The hitch? None of them rely on advertising to generate revenue. A few years ago, before the rise of mobile, every new startup had a line item on its business plan that assumed some advertising revenue. I found this contrast a little startling and a little scary. My colleagues cautioned me not to read too much into this. They said that the startups we were meeting with were all early stage and focused more on the product than on revenue. But I don’t think that’s entirely true. I’m actually impressed that most of the mobile-oriented startups I’m seeing today — in Silicon Valley and New York — do have a plan for revenue. Usually, it’s subscription or some other fee for service. And usually there’s little to no assumption of advertising as a revenue stream. The startups I spoke with believe there are better ways to make money in mobile than advertising. I think this is very telling and worrisome for all the people reading this piece: Advertising on mobile devices is still broken. Most of the non-search budgets are going to display and everyone wonders whether tiny little banners at the bottom or top of the screen work. Search is the killer revenue driver and is locked up by the same companies that dominate desktop search. Targeting and geo-location tools are advancing rapidly, but they’re being used to make poor creative units work a little better instead of re-shaping the whole mobile experience. Facebook and Twitter are doing a great job serving native ads on mobile devices and have shown us that native on mobile is a requirement. But how many more companies have been able to create native mobile experiences? A number of companies — like Tinder, Jelly and Spotify — are experimenting with the card design format (thanks to kbs+ Ventures director Taylor Davidson for pointing this out in his blog). But too many seem to still rely on the 300 x 50, and there still seems to be fundamental infrastructure problems. Reliable cross-device audience attribution is nearly impossible without first party data (e.g. Log in info) and creative experiences are mostly horrible. The medium that most of us spend most of our time with is not an ideal way to engage customers outside of brand-owned apps. Startups are creating mobile businesses because we’ve become a mobile society, but advertising is being left behind. As an industry, we don’t seem to be working fast enough to fix these issues, and we don’t seem entirely worried. Looking back on the rise of agencies, it seems like our growth has been connected to the rise of new mediums and media innovation. As the fortunes of TV went, so did our fortunes. As we applied innovation to the media-buying marketplace, we grew and our companies became more valuable. But what happens when the new medium isn’t advertising-friendly and the people who are innovating in the medium aren’t trying to make the medium work for advertising? I love this business, and I believe that some of the smartest and most innovative people work in this business. But I’m a little worried that we’re not moving fast enough to create meaningful mobile advertising experiences and we’re not trying to solve the attribution and measurement challenges fast enough. On our tour of Silicon Valley, we met with a brilliant guy at Twitter. He said something like, “Mobile is hitting the nuclear reset button.” He’s right."}

Ranieri faces a similarly formidable challenge if he is to lift Fulham out of the doldrums.\nBut he believes the Londoners can be competitive again. He will take charge of his first game in 10 days’ time when Fulham welcome fellow strugglers Southampton to Craven Cottage.\n“This Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table. I know this team is very capable of better performances, which we will work on straight away as we prepare for Southampton at the Cottage,” added Ranieri.\nRanieri will then face former clubs Chelsea and Leicester in successive games."}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you reason why having a larger pool of eligible organ donors is important and what factors determine whether or not someone can donate their organs?\n\nPassage: SHEBOYGAN - Aurora Sheboygan Memorial Medical Center was among 75 plus hospitals statewide to raise a special \"Donate Life\" flag for National Donate Life Month.\nIn a ceremony outside the hospital, Aurora leadership officials like Chief Clinical Services Officer Terry Miller and hospital Chaplain Darren Beachy gave remarks about the importance of organ donation to a crowd of about 40.\nThe flag was raised at 10:08 a.m. To signify the fact that one donor can save eight lives.\nThen following the raising of the flag there was a moment of silence for one minute and 14 seconds. The number 114 is significant because it recognizes the 114,000 plus patients still waiting for organ donations in the country.\nThis was followed by chaplain Beachy stressing the importance of organ donation. He stated that he has multiple family members who have benefited from organ donations themselves.\nLori Knitt, Vice President of Nursing at Aurora Sheboygan said this is not unique. Many of the medical providers and thus the community have been impacted by organ donations.\nAccording to hospital officials, as of Jan. 2018, 56.2 percent of drivers and ID holders in the county have registered to be donors. The statewide average is 57 percent.\n\"Not everyone can be an organ donor, depending on the circumstances that brought them to us,\" Knitt said. \"So the more eligible pool of candidates, the better.\"\nTo become an organ donor, you can join the Wisconsin Organ & Tissue Donor Registry or you can sign up when you renew your license at your local Department of Motor Vehicles."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the five important habits to incorporate into a marketing strategy as discussed in the text material? Answer according to: What sets some businesses apart from others is not just their creativity behind their content; it boils down to practicing effective marketing habits that allow them to conduct their campaigns at a high level.\nIf you’re looking for ways to improve your business’s marketing strategy, breaking down habits into daily, weekly or monthly tasks and reviews can make a profound impact on how followers and potential customers view your online presence.\nAlong with creating or revamping your marketing game plan, here are five important habits to incorporate into your marketing strategy.\nWrite Relevant Content: Knowing what’s going on in your industry allows you to deliver the content your audience wants. Savvy content marketers are on top of the latest industry trends, and optimize for timely keywords that get the most traction. Google Trends is a great tool to utilize to learn about industry trends and ideas for timely content.\nScope Out the Competition: To understand how to better market your business, it’s crucial to check out your competition and determine what they are doing differently. It’s not enough to just visit their website or social media profiles, but you should also analyze the type of content they are producing and how their followers engage with their content.\nListen to Your Customers: The point of social media is to be social. Praises of quality customer service are always great to have, but when it comes to receiving reviews that are not so pleasant, be sure to acknowledge areas of improvement and implement new strategies to increase the quality of your products or services.\nDevelop Contacts: Establishing relationships is an integral component of gaining a following of your brand. Networking with patrons of your business and engaging with potential customers is a hands-on method of creating a list of contacts. By developing business contacts, you’re also given another opportunity to engage with them by sending email newsletters and adding them on other social media profiles.\nAdvertise and Promote: Sometimes it takes spending a little more to profit from your work. Utilizing marketing and advertising tools such as Google AdWords, or social media advertising platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter are great means of putting your business at the forefront of users who are searching for products or services that you offer."}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Why is GeForce NOW only available through NVIDIA's SHIELD family of devices?\n\nPassage: On October 1,NVIDIA Corporation formally launched its long-awaited cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW. For $7.99 per month, GeForce NOW gives members instant access to more than 50 PC games -- no discs, downloads, or software updates required -- including AAA titles likeBatman: Arkham Origins and LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.And GeForce NOW can do so without sacrificing the quality or responsiveness gamers demand; it&apos;s the first cloud-gaming service capable of streaming at 60 frames per second at full 1080p HD.\nAnd if its price didn&apos;t immediately invoke a mental comparison to certain popular video streaming platform, NVIDIA left no room for doubting its intentions by describingGeForce NOW as \"a revolutionary game-streaming service -- the Netflix of games.\"\nAfter all, similar to Netflix, NVIDIA&apos;s GeForce NOW primarily operates on an unlimited streaming model. Though more similar to Amazon Instant Video, GeForce NOW also lets players purchase and stream hit new releases for an additional cost, such as The Witcher 3 and Resident Evil: Revelations 2.\nJust one \"problem\"But there&apos;s a catch: GeForce NOW is only available through NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD family of devices. As it stands, that means you can only subscribe to GeForce NOW if you own one of NVIDIA&apos;s $299 SHIELD portable handhelds, a high-powered NVIDIA SHIELD tablet starting at $299, or -- most recently -- a $199 SHIELD Android TV console.\nLeft to right: NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Android TV, and SHIELD Tablet. Image source: NVIDIA.\nPart of this requirement stems from the fact that NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD family is powered by its own Tegra series mobile superchips, which NVIDIA can ensure will work seamlessly with the Kepler architecture-based GPUs contained in the remote servers that host the games. To be sure, it only seems rational that, served to a similar-sized audience, NVIDIA&apos;s sheer computing, hardware, and bandwidth requirements for handling interactive games from the cloud would easily trump Netflix&apos;s comparatively \"simple\" one-way display of video content.\nOf course, this might be a moot point if NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD devices were wildly popular. But while each piece of SHIELD hardware has its merits, the simple fact is that NVIDIA has sold very few overall.\nTo be fair, NVIDIA hasn&apos;t disclosed exactly how many SHIELD tablets, portables, and Android TV units are out there. But we can glean an estimate from a battery-related recall of the SHIELD Tablet issued in July, which NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang admitted involves \"most\" SHIELD Tablets the company has sold to date. A subsequent press release from theU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reveals that the recall covers 83,000 SHIELD tablets sold between July 2014 and July 2015 in the U.S., and another 5,000 affected devices in Canada.\nThat said, this doesn&apos;t give us an idea of SHIELD Android TV or Portable sales. But SHIELD Android TV was only just introduced this past March, and the SHIELD Portable doesn&apos;t exactly boast the same consumer appeal as the SHIELD tablet. It&apos;s no wonder, then, that the three devices have collectively had little material impact on NVIDIA&apos;s top or bottom lines so far.\nApples and orangesBy contrast, Netflix added3.3 million subscribers in the second quarter alone, ending the period with more than 65 million streaming customers.And as any technologically aware consumer can attest, part of the allure of Netflix is its relative ubiquity in a vast array of electronic devices. No matter which television, Blu-ray player, streaming media stick or gaming console you purchase, you can generally rest assured the Netflix logo will be available the first time you press the power button. Heck, even SHIELD users can effortlessly speak the words \"launch Netflix\" into their controllers to browse their favorite TV shows and movies.\nThat&apos;s not to say NVIDIA SHIELD won&apos;t continue to expand its reach. Since the initial launch, the SHIELD team has announced new curated content for the devices on a weekly basis. And less than two weeks ago, NVIDIA announced the availability of SHIELD Android TV in the U.K., France, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Also last month, Google began offering SHIELD as an accessory to all current and prospective Google Fiber customers in Provo, Utah, Kansas City, Missouri, and Austin, Texas.\nBut to realize GeForce NOW&apos;s full potential, NVIDIA needs to find a way to make the service accessible through a much broader array of hardware devices, ideally from multiple manufacturers. Unless that happens, it remains unlikely NVDIA will ever be able to accurately call GeForce NOW the \"Netflix of games.\"\nThe article The No. 1 Reason NVIDIA Can&apos;t Be the Netflix of Games...Yet originally appeared on Fool.com.\nSteve Symington owns shares of NVIDIA.

The home has a spectacularly equipped 6,000-square-foot game room.\nThe room features a two-lane bowling alley, a Skee-Ball arcade game, a Claw-Machine grabber game, air hockey, pinball machines, a racing-car and motorcycle game system, golf simulator, a racquetball court, movie theater and full concession stand. There’s also a game machine with 200 classic games from the 1980s and 1990s, including Pac-Man.\nThe owners spent over $2 million to construct the game room, according to Senada Adzem, executive director of sales at Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Boca Raton, the listing agent for the home.\nThe estate, at 16141 Quiet Visa Circle, is in Stone Creek Ranch, a gated community off Lyons Road in unincorporated Palm Beach County. The community is particularly popular with high-level business executives because it offers privacy and security, as well as easy access to shopping, restaurants, entertainment and private schools, Adzem said.\n“People feel like they can have the home of their dreams, but they’re really secure,” Adzem said. “They also like the fact that it’s not a golf-course community.”Other features of the estate include four bedrooms, five full and one half baths, an office, custom gym, wine room and living room with a floor-to-ceiling granite fireplace.

For what reasons do customers choose them over their immediate competitors?\nAlmost all the executives polled reported that the primary factor behind customers choosing their company over their competitors had to do with the individual relationships and interactions that their customers had with them.\nIt should be obvious from this that trust and customer relationships are, by far, the most powerful drivers of any company’s competitive triumph over its other immediate competitors.\nIt’s not usually on account of price, or even product quality, but usually as a result of their relationship with and trust of the company or of some people within the company.\nTo raise your level of competitive success in your own business it would be a good idea to make a conscious effort each week, to strengthening the relationships you have with your customers.\nFrom a competitive standpoint, this will definitely be time well spent.

{"prompt": "It was a bright Sunday 17th March when we met at Sawbridgeworth station for Trevor’s walk. The sun shone and the wind, though brisk, was pleasant.\nOff we went along the towpath by the River Stort. Quite a few houseboats were by the river’s edge although nobody could be seen. The towpath was muddy but that was insignificant as the weather changed dramatically. At one moment we would have our hats off, jackets half undone and the next minute we would be cowering from a hailstorm. It is true that in England you can have all four seasons in one hour. We did! When the weather was good we were able to look around and see signs of spring everywhere, from buds on trees to already flowering forsythia. We saw a small creature swim across the river but it was too swift for us to identify and it hid in the river bank.\nInevitably on a seven mile walk a comfort break was required but squatting amongst brambles is not the way. No names but the shrieks could be heard for a hundred yards.\nWe had our packed lunches at Thorley Church, in their well maintained churchyard. It even had a table and chairs for us plus, big bonus, the church hall was open so we could use their loo. Eileen brought out a cake that was left over from her church do the previous evening and we all voted it a very good cake, as did the robin that kept us company.\nOn with the walk, through a former WW11 airfield. We stopped for a moment which allowed me to take a photo of us standing in sunshine with a black cloud looming behind. That black cloud was to come over us later. We struggled to find the path about here as the land seemed to be owned by a paintball firm. Eventually we made our way through and then, as we crossed an open field with no shelter, that black cloud hit us. Horizontal hailstones! All of us now had wet trousers but wet only on the right side where the hail lashed us.\nWe passed a building which housed, according to a sign outside, members belonging to the NFBA. Never heard of it? The clue was in the other organisation listed, the Herts and Essex Cricket Academy. Batsman could be heard facing up to fast bowling in readiness for the new season. I never knew there was a National Fast Bowling Academy.\nGetting tired now, we elected to go straight back to Sawbridgeworth station with a plan to stop in a pub if we found one. Alas, there was no pub open on late Sunday afternoon in March on our route and, unrefreshed, we dragged our weary bodies back to the station to make our way home.\nIs there any information mentioned in the text about the National Fast Bowling Academy and the Herts and Essex Cricket Academy? Please explain."}

{"prompt": "Who would have thought teens would still read British girls’ boarding-school stories in the 21stcentury? I suppose this topic came to be because my niece is home from boarding school and I was going through her books. Outside of my small group, though, who’d would want to read about a plucky new girl scoring the winning goal in lacrosse when there are powerful wizards, alluring vampires and enterprising undercover spies out there on the bookshelves, fictitious teenagers saving much more interesting and dangerous worlds?\nWell, plenty of readers, it seems, because the British girls’ boarding-school novel made a surprising comeback from 2007, beginning with Sara Lawrence’s High Jinx. Carmen Reid’s St Jude’s series about Gina Peterson and her friends began in 2008 and numbers six books to date. The Saffina Desforges writing team (which included two teenagers) released the entertaining St Mallory’s Forever! earlier this year.\nSo what are the main differences between the classic British girls’ boarding-school stories of the past and the ones that are being written now?\nToday’s fictional boarding-school girls have relationships. They meet hot boys in town on Saturdays and smuggle them into parties at school. Chastity Maxwell in High Jinx even ‘shags the handyman’ in the sixth-form boarding-house.\nThey’re not all into boys, of course. Some of them date girls. Today’s fictional lesbian schoolgirls are out and proud – you don’t have to read between the lines as you did with the Chalet School back in the day.\nThey might look and read like chick lit for teenage girls, but contemporary British girls’ boarding-school stories cover some serious issues. What’s it like to have your dad come out as gay or have his business empire suddenly collapse, as happens to Amy in the St Jude’s books. How do you deal with parental pressure to do well at school? How do you handle going to a boarding-school where your mum is one of the teachers? What happens when a jealous rival sends a photo of you partying to your strict Muslim father?\nOMG! The use of slang was a problem for the teachers at the Chalet School. They’d go nuts if they heard the language of fictional schoolgirls today. Not only that, but the girls sneak out to smoke (and not always cigarettes…) and smuggle booze into the dorm. But for all the partying, the girls have high expectations of themselves. Even the seemingly dizziest ones are serious about becoming a lawyer.\nThe most important similarity though is the friendships. Girls like Jinx, Gina and Helen are as loyal to their besties as Darrell, Joey and Dimsie ever were. Living together 24/7 brings them close together; they become family to each other, and support each other through work woes, parental break-up, body image struggles…and, of course, those broken hearts.\nThere may not be opportunities to learn about potions or surveillance, but there are worse places for teenage characters to spend the best years of their lives. Based on the passage above, What are some of the serious issues that contemporary British girls’ boarding-school stories address and how do they differ from the typical themes found in other young adult literature?"}

{"prompt": "What did Andrew Price discuss in his recent presentation about Blender development?\nGenerate according to: Blender 2.5 has been slowly progressing, as more developers start focusing on bug fixing, and well rounding, instead of Sintel (which has enjoy lots of success). Blender 2.55 beta was released on November 4th, and continues to build on Blender's ever growing series of betas. Despite the seemingly never ending cycle, progress is being made. Hundreds of bug fixes have been made, in fact during the last month more than 300 bugs reports were closed. However there are still bugs in the program, and so about the same number have bugs have been reported. Still if you check out Letwory Interactive, which publishes status updates on the development of Blender, it would appear that we are starting to close more bugs then are being reported. According to the developers, we could be expecting the final release somewhere in the next three to five months.\nAlso having to do with Blender development is a cool post made over at BlenderGuru.\nAndrew Price recently made an almost hour long presentation at the Blender Conference 2010, and now he has posted it as a video on the web. He also summed it up, for all of us who don't like watching 50 minute-long videos on the internet, as a series of photographs and short summaries on the same page. It is a very interesting summary of what Blender could do better, especially on it's website, as well as cointaing a gold mine of statistics about the Blender community. During the presentation he finally released the results of a large survey that he took a couple months ago, which was very interesting to look at.\nSo Blender development is continuing, and we are all looking forward to the great Blender 2.6 release, however if you want to start warming to it now, go download the latest Blender beta, and also feel free to help out Blender development by submitting more bug reports at Blender Projects (you will need to make an account there first though)."}

{"prompt": "Given the text: Are you an artist or musician just starting out? Are you anxious for your music to be heard by others, but don’t know how to get it out there? Well, in this article I am going to give you some tips and advice on how to get noticed on Social Media! First let’s talk about social media platforms that you can use to advertise your music. Great examples are Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, Snapchat, Vine, YouTube, Soundcloud and Spotify. Soundcloud or Spotify: You can create your own profile on either application. You can then upload multiple songs you have written or covered. Personally, I think having a Soundcloud or Spotify is very important, because you can link your profile on other social media apps. Instagram/Facebook/Vine/Youtube/Twitter/Tumblr: Above, I talked about Soundcloud and Spotify. Now, in your social media profile you can put a web link to your Spotify or Soundcloud music profile. You can post videos or audio of your music for your friends/followers to see. If they are interested in hearing more, tell them to go check out more of your work on your Soundcloud or Spotify, which will be linked on your profile. Snapchat: You can send small video clips of you playing music to your friends, and if they are interested send them the link to your Spotify or Soundcloud. Now let me give you a few tips on how to have more people interested in hearing your work. If you have an Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Vine etc., dedicated to your music, follow other similar artist accounts. If they follow you back, message them and ask if they could listen to your music and you’ll listen to their music as well. Try to perform in local places. Go around to restaurants or places that may allow you to play your music for a night. Post on your social media that you are performing there, and encourage people to come see you. It’s a win-win situation for you and the restaurant or place you are performing at. More customers for them, and it will help you and your music get ‘known’. Hand out pamphlets with your social media information and your Soundcloud or Spotify so they can check out more of your music online. Make an artist website, all about your passion for music. Post videos of you performing, post when and where you are doing a gig, even blog. You can link this to other social media outlets as well. Have conversations with your friends/fans! If people give you feedback on your music, or compliment it, thank them for listening to your work. Being genuine and pleasant to fans may encourage get people to tell their friends about your music as well. Also, if you are playing out somewhere, ask them what songs they’d like to hear. Being interactive with fans is important. Don’t make EVERYTHING about marketing your music. Although it’s great to promote yourself, don’t make that your only priority. You need some balance between personal content and marketing content. There is general rule called the 80/20 rule. That means that 80% of your posts should be personal, humorous and entertaining. Keep it social and enjoyable. That leaves a good 20% for promoting and marketing your music career. Overall, I think the most important rule is to be yourself! What are some offline methods that musicians can use to promote their music, and how can they use social media to support these efforts?"}

{"prompt": "When these bodies come to birth?\nAs the child learns to grow.\nIn the whirlpools of the mind.\nBury your toes in the sand.\nTo find joy with all who grieve.\nThe sun’s warmth calls in the fog. The air feels heavy, the world enclosed around me. I can see the droplets of fog moving toward me; I breathe them in, swallow them; the drops cling to my hair, my eyelashes. The sky feels close. The sky does not exist.\nAs I step off the hard concrete of the sidewalk and onto the soft, leaf-strewn path, the world shifts. The density of the trees now surrounding me begin to block out the reality that I am in the heart of a thriving city. With each step I enter further into a quieter world. My footsteps are muffled and the ground has a certain give, almost an elasticity beneath my feet. Before me, on either side of the path, redwood after redwood stands in silent vigil. Their dark trunks seem quiet, but the further I walk the more I hear new sounds. A slight creaking in the upper, slimmer branches. The softest splattering of water drops on leaves, as the fog condenses on twig and leaf, descending in widening pearls of water. The smallest drops of water can nourish these trees as they drink in through both their roots and branches. The fog lies so heavily upon this city grove that it obscures the uppermost branches of the redwoods, making the height of the trees seem nearly infinite; they disappear long before they end.\nAs I move toward the heart of this small yet encompassing forest the landscape becomes darker, the few glimpses of light beyond the woods standing out more starkly than the tree trunks themselves. Walking up to one of the redwoods I lay my hand upon its bark. At first sight it seems to be so rough, split open with massive chasms as the tree has grown ever larger over the decades. Yet under my fingers I realize this bark is soft, the fibers feeling like unwoven fabric to my touch. The faintest trace of moss grows upon the outer surface of the bark, fading imperceptibly to the reddish-brown of the tree’s natural hue. Beneath my hand the tree feels so richly alive, yet so still, existing at a pace almost, but not quite, slower than I am capable of imagining.\nAs I turn my back to the tree and lean against it in full repose, I see a single leaf fall into my line of sight before settling anonymously upon the forest floor. The ground is everywhere strewn with brown leaves, a full covering that lets off a rich, fragrant scent; yet watching this single leaf fall I recognize that each of these leaves has made the journey from branch to floor in its own time and in its own way. Each one has a story, although perhaps few have a witness other than the tree that released it to the ground.\nAt last I separate myself from the tree on which I am leaning and continue through the woods to its edge. The pathway opens out; the pathway ends in rose blossoms.\nBut this one we may get right. Based on the passage above, Can you continue the story of the single leaf falling from the tree and its journey to the ground?"}

Chris Christie’s (R) bridge scandal grows more interesting every day, as new evidence emerges, new questions arise, and new developments unfold. We don’t yet know why the Christie administration engaged in this corruption, who else was involved, who might yet turn on whom, and when the next shoe might drop.\nAnd with all this intrigue surrounding one of the GOP’s highest-profile figures, the nation’s highest-ranking Republican official made the funniest comment of his professional career.\nUm, no. Actually, it’s not time to move on. Ordinarily, it’s time to move on when all of the relevant questions have been answered, not when all of the relevant questions remain unanswered.\n* 20 new subpoenas are going out.\n* The Senate Transportation Committee received information from the Port Authority, and found “no evidence” to support the “traffic study” excuse still being touted by Christie last week.\n* The state Assembly has begun its new legislative session by creating a special investigatory committee to oversee the probe into the scandal. As Rachel noted on the show last night, it will be led in part by former federal prosecutor Reid Schar, who helped convict former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich (D).\n* The state Senate is also moving forward with its own investigation.\n* The Christie administration has lawyered up.\n* Bridget Kelly has lawyered up.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Is there any indication yet as to why the Christie administration engaged in this corruption?"}

The Super 14 table would look very different from a Chiefs point of view had they managed to see off the Crusaders and Brumbies in the past fortnight but Foster is at least thankful his charges seem to be learning from their mistakes. Three in a row, and he might have been found lying on one of Gilbert Enoka's special reclining couches. \"The last two games have hurt us, not so much to lose but to lose two close games,\" he explained. \"To win this game is mentally important for us. When you come off two, pretty tight, gut-wrenching games, to win one that went down to the wire... Showed we learned a big lesson from the last two games. \"Our challenge is now to put another one on the board.\" The first assignment will be against the Bulls, who suffered the rare ignominy of going down to the Blues on Friday night. But, as Foster pointed out, they are still ahead of his side on the all-important table. Winning is what the Highlanders need to do for the rest of the season. It was a pragmatic Greg Cooper who contemplated his side's predicament as they are left counting the steps on the ladder they will need to climb to pull themselves into the playoffs. But Cooper will take a stoic Southern Man approach to his side's final five games. \"We obviously have to win all of those games [to make the semifinals],\" Highlanders coach Cooper said. \"But I think rugby has to be bigger than that, we also have to respect who we play for. \"While the playoffs are there, it's also a matter of doing justice to the jersey, the region and your team-mates as well.\" Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How does the Highlanders coach plan on motivating his team for their remaining games of the season?"}

As I was eating dinner last night I envisioned the leftover couscous with a steamed egg and a bit of bacon, parmesan, and parsley sprinkled on top. I made it for lunch today and it was AMAZING. I will seriously make this recipe again and again. I wish I had more leftover couscous so I could make this dish for lunch again tomorrow. I highly recommend this recipe!\nIf you don&rsquo;t have leftover couscous, see recipe here.\nCook the bacon in a small skillet over medium heat.

I found this recipe at Cookie and Kate that looked perfect and it used what I already had on hand which was very convenient. I love the texture of Israeli couscous and it soaked the flavor of the lemony vinaigrette up nicely. I also really enjoyed the subtle flavor and crisp texture of the raw vegetables.

They are terrific in soups, lasagna, rice, pasta, or on their own. I recently picked up a box of Israeli couscous, so when I stumbled upon this recipe from Kitchen Grrrrls, I couldn&rsquo;t resist making it. I adapted the recipe to suit our tastes and what I had on hand. I have to say, I LOVED THIS DISH! The Israeli couscous was light, flavorful, and had a great texture. The roasted veggies gave great flavor and texture to the couscous and topping it with salty feta was perfect. I paired this couscous with salmon and it was a healthy and delicious meal. I have a feeling I will be eating the leftover couscous for breakfast tomorrow.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees.

{"prompt": "Can you provide some details about the application process and training process for students in the Youth Intern Program at Explora, as well as the roles of mentors and portfolios in supporting the program's goals? Answer according to: Explora, a children’s museum and science center, is one of the most vibrant, stimulating, and fascinating places for children and adults alike, with a wide range of hands-on discovery exhibits about science, technology, and art. Many in Albuquerque know Explora as a special place for making science, technology, and art accessible to visitors, but fewer know that Explora has a hidden gem in its Youth Intern Program. In operation since 2004, the 2.5 year program offers low-income, high-achieving high school students an opportunity to learn science, technology, engineering, math, and art concepts, and to teach and serve as role models for children.\nDaisy, a recent graduate of the University of New Mexico, completed the Youth Intern Program in 2011. She was the first in her family to attend college. Today she has her undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and is working in a laboratory utilizing math to investigate biomedical topics. Daisy says that she fell in love with math after being paired with a scientist during her internship at Explora. She grew her passion for math by teaching and mentoring elementary students through Explora’s educational programs.\nExplora’s mission is “creating opportunities for inspirational discovery and the joy of lifelong learning through interactive experiences in science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM).” The 2.5-year Youth Intern Program, designed for promising but disadvantaged high school students, exemplifies Explora’s mission. Interns’ exposure to STEAM learning, professional skills, and community involvement is expected to be a pathway out of poverty into a rewarding career. Interns also learn to question, explore, articulate, and then enjoy the rewarding experience of educating younger children. They develop strong ties to the community through outreach, and receive valuable mentoring to plan for college and career.\nExplora’s Youth Intern Program has provided about 30 paid internships a year for low-income, high-achieving, and culturally diverse high school students in Albuquerque. Students are recommended by teachers and then apply during their sophomore year. To participate, they must qualify for federal lunch program. Once accepted, the sophomore interns join the junior and senior cohorts, and stay in the program for additional 2.5 years through senior year.\nOrientation Semester: Before being selected for full internships, interested sophomores who have been recommended by their teachers come to Explora during the spring semester to learn about the organization and about principles of experiential education, while developing essential workforce skills including effective work behaviors, résumé writing, and successful interviewing.\nCompetitive Application Process: To be selected for full internships, students must actively participate in the orientation semester, complete an application, provide two adult references, and interview at Explora with their adult sponsor or parent.\nMulti-Step Program: Once part of the team, student interns spend summers and afterschool hours learning about the exhibits and educational units delivered to elementary school students. Steps in the training process include experiencing a program as a student, experimenting with the program materials, learning the science behind the program, observing Explora educators, assisting Explora educators in providing the program, pairing with another intern to team-teach the program, and finally teaching the program solo to public elementary school students who come to the museum. The interactive, inquiry-based learning as well as the teaching assignments prepare students in STEAM concepts and also in community engagement.\nPortfolios: Interns maintain portfolios on their progress, including self-evaluations; Explora staff use portfolios and attendance data to evaluate the interns’ performance and experience.\nMentors: Each intern is matched with a mentor who supports their job performance and helps them explore potential careers. Mentors also provide support for the students’ high school academic programs, and assist in selecting and applying to colleges.\nStipends: Interns receive a stipend during the school year and summer.\n31 students participated in the program during the 2014-15 school year.\nThe interns facilitated STEM explorations for 8,054 low-income elementary school students.\nHow well do we do it?\n84% of interns were retained over the 2014-15 school year.\nIn 2014-15, interns accumulated at total of 8,200 contact hours, or an average of about 265 hours per student.\n100% of 12th grade interns graduated at the end of the 2014-15 school year.\n Martinez-Papponi, B., & Genné (2014). High School College Going Report: 2007-2013 Trends and Analysis. Albuquerque, NM: APS Research and Accountability.\nTo be selected for a Bright Spot, a program had to provide evidence that children or adults touched by their interventions were better off after participating. While the strength of evidence varied from program to program, all Bright Spots were able to show – at minimum – a correlation between participation in their program and positive outcomes. Those with stronger evidence provided pre- and post-data on participants in comparison to a similar group that did not participate."}

{"prompt": "It is my favorite song. Sung beautifully by Miranda Lambert. It is about a 20 something (she must be young) who is trying to find herself and goes to her childhood home. Well I'm not 20 anything, I found myself a long time ago, but for some reason as I plan my next move to our 8th residence in a 24 year marriage, I get a little nostalgic. This is the house my kids will most remember. But it is the house that \"built\" me I lovingly remember.\nI spent my preschool and elementary years in Clinton, Iowa. By the time we moved I was entering high school and was the only child at home. So the house in Clinton that was full of family is the one I pine for. It is a gorgeous English Tudor sitting on a large hill with views of the Mississippi River. It was once a retreat for an order of monks which explains the cross mowed into the lawn. It sat on an acre of property, most of it woods, and had a beautiful stone patio, an enormous screened in porch and a balcony from my parents room. The wood was heavy and dark, and every room had built in closets, dressers and shelves. The windows are were all leaded glass and there were 2 huge picture windows. In the spring there were dozens of lilac trees and bushes of peonies. In the summer we would have thousands of monarch butterflies and in the fall we would collect hedge apples and pine cones.\nChristmas was magical. My dad would string the big Charlie Brown bulbs all over the hedges and when the snow would fall they would glow in bursts of color. Our huge tree would proudly stand at the living room picture window. We would have cut it down ourselves and decorated with the dozens of family ornaments and tossed tinsel all over it. I never thought to look for the Christmas presents hidden on the screened in porch, but many years later I learned that was my mom's favorite place to hide them.\nOf course the house had a basement, and a pit in the garage that my brothers used to learn to work on their cars. And my favorite spot was the breakfast room with its octagonal shape and all the leaded windows. No one could come in either driveway without being seen. My last bedroom (I had to wait until the older sisters went to college), had a wall of windows that looked out over the river. It was such a magical place. I have the photographs and the memories, and this time of year makes me think of a particular cooking memory. In the Betty Crocker cooky cookbook that is falling apart, are the many recipes we made. I blogged about it before and decided that it was the perfect time to make Pumpkin Cookies. These are the cookies I made on September 24, 1976. The note next to the recipe says \"couldn't go skating\". It was a sad day. Every fall we had a roller skating party and it was the one night a year a 7th grade girl (in 1976) could hold hands to a Shawn Cassidy song and roller skate a memory. But alas, I didn't clean my room, and the meanest mom in the entire world made me stay home. She probably launched my love of baking and journaling through recipes. I remember the night clearly. It is, after these many years, a very happy memory. Needless to say I couldn't make the recipe as it is written, so here it is with my changes.\nOkay, my changes. Shortening does make a really soft cookie, but butter just tastes better. And I think raisins are yucky in a cookie, so chocolate chips, perfect replacement. The recipe says the cookies can be iced with a thin butter icing. Would you ice a chocolate chip cookie? I mean, the recipes are very similar. I say enjoy the pumpkin! This recipe makes about 6 dozen and they do not spread, so you can really cram them on the baking sheets.\nWhat is the significance of the screened-in porch in the author's childhood home during Christmas time?"}

{"prompt": "Here is a piece of text: When I was 14, the muscles necessary for me to chew and swallow became very weak. After months of high-calorie shakes and sometimes even straight Häagen-Dazs, my parents drove me to Sutter Memorial Hospital where I had a stomach tube placed. That small, plastic device has quite literally kept me alive for more than 20 years.\nA few years ago, my chest muscle lost the strength to fully expand my lungs. I exhausted every noninvasive therapy, and then it was time to head back to Sutter Memorial. I was taken into an operating room where a direct airway called a tracheotomy was placed in my neck. I could breathe easy yet again.\nAll of these medical challenges are the result of missing a single gene that is essential for proper muscle function. When I was diagnosed, the doctors told my parents we would never see a treatment to address the genetic underpinnings of this disease.\nHowever, a lot can happen in more than three decades, and late last year the FDA approved the first-ever treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. It was an amazing achievement.\nAnd then Sutter came through once again. The medication is extremely expensive, and in certain cases like mine, it can be very difficult to administer.\nYet when there is a group of people who are motivated by a genuine desire to have a positive impact on someone’s life, the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes conceivable and then even achievable. In November, I became the first adult in the region to receive this groundbreaking treatment at a Sacramento hospital.\nThis most recent medical success would have never occurred without the efforts of Dr. Bradley Chipps, Dr. Shailesh Asaikar, Dr. Lotfi Hacein-Bey, Dr. Robert Moynihan, their nurses, support staff, and nameless other administrators who were all up for the challenge.\nIt takes excellent people to create excellent outcomes, and to each of them I express my immense gratitude.\nDavid Bekhour is a graduate of the UC Davis School of Law. Reach him at @OptimisticGrin.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you explain the role of excellent people in creating excellent outcomes, as mentioned by David Bekhour in his article?"}

{"prompt": "What is the general consensus on the texture and richness of the carrot pecan bread described in the material? Generate according to: After making so many rich and gooey things this week, I thought I’d switch gears and make something kind of wholesome and useful. This carrot pecan bread recipe is based on an old recipe from a 1984 Southern Living annual, so it’s (at least) 24 years old. Doesn’t it seem strange that 1984 was 24 whole years ago? 1984 seems like yesterday. I hated the ’80s but I sort miss them still. Anyway. This pecan bread, unlike the eighties, is not defined by excess. It has a low but reasonable amount of oil and all kinds of healthy (’60s!) ingredients like whole wheat flour, carrots and nuts. This was pretty darn healthy…so I made it with one slight change – I replace some of the oil with ground Flax Seed. It was delish so I decided to blog about it to my friends…thanks so much for the inspiration!!! It looks delish and I think it smells wonderful too, Anna! Mimi’s is one of our favorite restaurants and I LOVE the carrot bread. Is there a recipe out there for it? We are now an hour away from the closest one and don’t get there as often. Sigh. Looks right up my alley – I love the carrot bundt cake with applesauce in it that you posted some time back. This looks like a good everyday type loaf. I’ve been missing the 80s lately, too. I think that shows how bad things are right now. Depressing! What I still can’t believe is that I graduated high school in 1984. Where does the time go? Have you ever made the carrot bread from Mimi’s restaurant? I used to love that stuff. Great – a recipe to use some KA whole wheat flour that’s been waiting. Perfect timing as usual. BTW – my hubby loved the PB & Nutella Brownies. He’d never had Nutella and they came out just pefectly. “This bread, unlike the eighties, is not defined by excess.” Anna, you always manage to bring a smile to my face with your fun metaphors, haha – love it! And that bread sounds wonderful – carrot & pecan is a delectable combination! FYI. I weighed my flour and used a total of about 10 1/4 oz — 6 oz all purpose, 4 1/4 oz whole wheat. This isn’t nearly as rich and moist as carrot cake. It’s definitely more of a quick bread — lower in fat, but not rubbery. Just today I bought a big bag of organic carrots to make baby food and was thinking I needed to search for something else to make with the leftovers…Anna to the rescue! Looks yummy, and you’re right, after all the ooey, gooey stuff, I’m thinking healthy. I’m about to make a healthy whole grain type muffin. Instead of quick breads, I always make them in mini muffin tins. My kids will eat a muffin, but not a slice of bread!"}

{"prompt": "Home Customizing Dynamics CRM Sub-Report Not Displaying? Here’s a Workaround 7 people are discussing this now.\nHow to create reports without using sub-reports.\nWhen building a custom FetchXML-based SSRS report with this type of data, most developers will gravitate towards displaying the account information in a report and passing the accounted to sub-report that displays the contact information. This may not be the best option for several reasons.\nThey can have some performance issues with loading more slowly due to multiple reports.\nThey can be difficult to manage. It’s easier to manage one report than to manage multiple reports. Each sub-report is a separate RDL (report definition file).\nWith Dynamics CRM reporting, each sub-report should have a separate data source because Dynamics CRM does not support shared data sources.\nThis blog assumes that the readers have knowledge on how to use FetchXML to develop custom SSRS report for Dynamics CRM. Our focus today is not to show how to create a FetchXM-based report, but to how show a technique that helps us build this report without a sub-report.\nAlso, we’ll be making this a “form-based” report, meaning this report can be run from an Account form by selecting the report from the ribbon (versus being run from the Reports area).\nWhen to build SQL based report and when to build FetchXML based report.\nHow to get the ID of the record that is opened and pass it to the report query as parameter. This is called pre-filtering in Dynamics CRM, which is required for form based reports.\nWithout further ado, here are the steps!\nCreate a Dataset i.e FilterDS to pull accountid while enabling prefiltering. This will enable the report to grab the GUID of the account the report is run from.\nCreate a parameter called account of datatype text.\nRight click the parameter account. Under properties, set the available and default value to point to the FilterDS and the accountid field as the value.\nNow create the main dataset (master dataset) for the account as you see below and apply the filter accountid equals the parameter @account.\nAlso create the detail dataset for contact and filter on parentcustomerid as you see below.\nNotice the @account parameter is key in both of these datasets. @account contains the ID (GUID) of the account record that the report is run for.\nThis will take care of the need to use sub-reports while still using the awesome feature of Dynamics CRM called Report Parameter Pre-filtering.\nby Joe D365\tFebruary 18, 2013 7 people are discussing this now. How does pre-filtering work in Dynamics CRM reporting and why is it required for form-based reports?"}

They moved to Meridian this summer so Levi could teach at Meridian High School. Teodora uses her music skills as an organist at First Christian Church in Meridian.\nLiving thousands of miles apart as children Levi and Teodora Mitze-Circiumaru never knew their love for music would one day bring the two together – or to Meridian.\nLevi Mitze-Circiumaru teaches Algebra I at Meridian High School and Teodora is the organist at First Christian Church where the two attend. As a young girl in Romania, Teodora started playing the piano when she was in fourth grade. She later discovered in high school she wanted to play the organ and began to take private lessons.\nLevi is also a musician having played the violin since the age of eight. He plays the violin at First Christian Church occasionally.\nThe two met when Teodora came to America in 2014 to pursue an Artist Diploma at Mercer University in Macon, Ga. Levi was at the university finishing his undergraduate degree in violin and computer science. Being from Romania Teodora said her first time to America was a little bit of a culture shock.\nAfter finishing her Artist Diploma, Teodora was offered a job in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. During the year they were living there, Levi Mitze-Circiumaru had the opportunity to play with several professional orchestras. But, the best experience was when the two had a second wedding with Teodora’s family in Sibiu, Romania, Levi said.\n“The ceremony was held at the Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral of Saint Mary – it was an incredible experience,” Levi said. “This city is like a medieval town, well preserved. So much beautiful architecture with a deep history.\nAfter living in Romania for a year the Mitze-Circiumarus decided to return to the states so Teodora could get her doctoral degree at Florida State University. While living in Florida, Levi Mitze-Circiumaru became interested in a program – The Mississippi Teacher Corps. A program that eventually led them to Meridian.\n“The program takes people who don’t have degrees in education but are suited to teach in a high need subject, like mathematics,” Mitze-Circiumaru said. “In return for a full tuition masters degree from the University of Mississippi, you can commit to teaching for two years in a high need school somewhere in Mississippi.\nThe Mitze-Circiumaru’s said since moving to Meridian a month ago they haven’t had much spare time, but when they do they enjoy playing music together, reading and watching movies.\nLevi Mitze-Circiumaru moved to Meridian with his wife, Teodora, so he could teach algebra at Meridian High School through the Mississippi Teacher Corps program. Their love of music brought the couple together. Levi, who previously has played violin with some orchestras, sometimes shares his talent with First Christian Church in Meridian.\nWhat is the Mississippi Teacher Corps program, and how did it bring the Mitze-Circiumaru's to Meridian?"}

The report is released weekly from April through October.\n“As we enter September crops continue to move towards maturity with harvest now just a few weeks away. It is great to see some farmers aerially seeding cover crops. Seed corn harvest is also getting underway,” Northey said.\nIt was a cool dry week in Iowa during the week ending September 3, 2017, according to USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service. Statewide there were 6.2 days suitable for fieldwork. Activities for the week included haying, hauling grain, chopping corn silage, seeding cover crops, and harvesting seed corn.\nTopsoil moisture levels rated 13 percent very short, 27 percent short, 59 percent adequate and 1 percent surplus. According to the August 29, 2017 U.S. Drought Monitor, areas of south central and southeast Iowa have been in a severe drought for 5 consecutive weeks. Subsoil moisture levels rated 17 percent very short, 31 percent short, 52 percent adequate and 0 percent surplus.\nNinety-four percent of the corn crop was in or beyond the dough stage, five days behind last year but three days ahead of the five-year average. Sixty percent of the corn crop has reached the dent stage, eight days behind last year and three days behind average. Corn condition rated 62 percent good to excellent. Eighteen percent of soybeans have started to turn color, five days behind last year and three days behind average. Soybean condition improved to 61 percent good to excellent. There were scattered reports of disease issues in soybeans such as sudden death syndrome.\nThe third cutting of alfalfa hay reached 91 percent complete, 8 days ahead of last year and over 2 weeks ahead of average. Pasture condition rated 16 percent very poor, 23 percent poor, 35 percent fair, 24 percent good and 2 percent excellent. Cooler temperatures have been ideal for livestock; however, there were still reports of producers in south central and southeast Iowa feeding hay to cattle due to poor pasture conditions.\nIt was a dry and unseasonably cool week across Iowa. Temperatures were below normal throughout the week except at a few western Iowa locations. Monday (28th) and Friday (1st) were the coolest days in most areas with daytime highs in the seventies. Temperature extremes for the week ranged from Friday (1st) morning lows of 41 degrees at Cresco and Elkader to a Saturday (2nd) afternoon high of 86 degrees at Albia. Temperatures for the week as a whole averaged from four to seven degrees below normal over the east to slightly above normal in the far northwest with a statewide average of 3.0 degrees subnormal. Most of the week’s rain came on Sunday (27th) when rain was scattered nearly statewide with some very small areas of heavy rain in the Dubuque and Burlington areas. There were some thunderstorms on Monday over extreme eastern Iowa, with some localized heavy rains around Burlington. There were some isolated showers on Thursday (31st), Friday (1st) and Saturday (2nd) but with rain totals mostly under one-tenth of an inch. Asbury in Dubuque County reported the most rain for the week with 3.31 inches while Burlington saw 2.72 inches. Much of central and south central Iowa saw little, if any rain. The statewide average rainfall amount was 0.11 inches while normal for the week is 0.88 inches. This was the state’s driest week in 12 weeks (mid-June). At Fairfield the summer rainfall total (June-July-August) was only 3.51 inches. This was their lowest summer rain total among 137 years of records at that location (old record 3.77 inches in 1911). The Ottumwa Airport recorded even less rain for the summer with 3.38 inches, but this amount ranked a distant second behind 1911’s 1.80 inch total at that location."}

However, considering the major ways the film updated the premise of the original Jumanji from over 20 years earlier, it was far from clear how the third Jumanji film would differentiate itself. While we still don't have many of those answers, we do know one thing, our heroes will end up in new costumes in the upcoming film, and that's something. Check out Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan's new outfits in the image below.\nWhile new costumes might not be massive breaking news, it would seem to tell us something about the new movie. A recent image of the cast from Karen Gillan had shown the main cast in the same clothes that they wore in the first film. It's unclear if this image was actually from the new movie or the previous one, but either way, it implied that we'd be getting the actors in the same outfits we got before. Although, it did promise things were not as they seemed, so perhaps this was part of the reason. When we actually saw the characters in the new film, they would look a little different.\nSince they're playing video game avatars, it would make sense that the characters would end up in the same clothes, and it's possible they may start out that way, but at some point things will change, as the Rock's Instagram picture reveals.\nBased on the outfits, it looks like Jumanji 3 may be taking our characters into a colder environment, as they're clearly dressed for keeping warm. Even Ruby Roundhouse as left her Lara Croft inspired shorts and crop top behind for fuzzy boots and long sleeves.\nShifting the setting of the new Jumanji from the tropical jungle to something colder is certainly one way to change things up. The \"ice level\" is a tried and true element of many great video games, so it would certainly be fitting to have the video game inspired Jumanji 3 use the idea as part of its premise.\nThe Rock's comment on his Instagram post also appears to confirm that Jumanji 3 will continue the story of the romance between the characters of Spencer and Martha. The teenagers inhabiting the two video game avatars began a relationship in Welcome to the Jungle and it seems the pair are no less awkward even though some time has passed since they got together.\nJumanji 3 is filming right now with a release date already set for this December. It will once again go up against the newest Star Wars movie at the box office, though that battle wasn't a major problem for Jumanji the last time around. With a fan base already looking forward to this sequel, it seems highly likely another big box office hit is on the way."}

{"prompt": "Indirect grilling requires little hands-on attention, but gives you maximum flavor. It's like slow cooking, but on the grill!\nThis technique is called indirect grilling, but it’s more like roasting, which means indirect heat, lower temps and longer cooking times.\nWhen you’re ready to get started, pull the beef out of the fridge and season well. Depending on your recipe, now’s the time to apply a rub, herbs or other spices.\nTake a few minutes to configure your grill. As the name suggests, indirect grilling positions the beef away from the heat source instead of directly over it. If you’re using charcoal, this means arranging the coals off to one side of the grill and cooking on the opposite side. If you’re using gas, refer to your owner’s manual and bring the grill to medium heat on one side only.\nKeep the lid closed for best results. You should follow your recipe for timing, but also may want to use an oven-proof meat thermometer to confirm when time’s almost up. Be careful not to overshoot your target temperature because it will continue to rise for several minutes after coming off the grill.\nDon’t skip this step! Resting is essential to keep all those delicious juices from draining out of the meat, and makes the next step easier. The larger cuts that work best for indirect grilling generally need more time to rest—often up to 15–20 minutes. Set the meat on your cutting board or a serving tray and cover it loosely with aluminum foil (this is called “tenting”).\nWhen you’re ready to carve, take care to not pierce the beef with a fork. Instead just use tongs to hold the roast in place. Depending on your recipe or desired presentation, slice the beef thinly across the grain and serve on a warm plate or tray.\nResting time is important because it allows the juices to stay in the meat, becoming easier to carve and serve.\nAn underrated component of any grill set-up, a drip pan—usually made of disposable foil— catches drippings from your meat, preventing dangerous flare-ups.\nCraving a hearty salad? Beef Tri-Tip Roast is marinated in a tangy balsamic vinaigrette and cooked on the grill. Paired with greens and other colorful vegetables for the perfect plate.\nCarne Asada is a Latin American dish, simply translating to \"grilled beef.\" Enjoy the flavors of the region with this classic grilled steak recipe.\nLooking for a new condiment to top your best burger?

{"prompt": "Question 1. Describe how the story is structured to influence your response to the text.\nQuestion 2. Describe one of the story’s major settings. How is it constructed and what is its significance to the story and its ideas?\nNorth America is the major setting in this book. North America holds a lot of new technology and everything is new and spectacular to him, the trains, the enormous rock sculptures and an endless farming field are examples of this. There is also a bad side to this place; there are huge cities of factories and tall buildings with thick smoke coming out of each building.\nBut above all, best place was California, where there were a strong sunlight, the Sierra Mountains and the seacoast. Along the way he had met and shook hands new people, which had different cultural backgrounds to him.\nThis setting is constructed in a way that the more the grandfather travels the more he liked it and wanted to make the ‘New World’ his home. This setting shows that the cultural barrier can be broken and people should go out and see the world and meet new people to develop more familiarity of the world they live in.\nQuestion 3. How are you positioned to respond to the major character/s of the story? What values are represented through them?\nQuestion 4. Describe the extent to which language and graphics are successfully used together to shape your response. Discuss with close reference to at lease two examples.\nIn the Grandfather’s Journey, there are a few pages where the graphics and the text connect together to give the reader a better understanding of situation.\nAt the beginning (on page 4) the text was ‘My grandfather was a young man when he left his home in Japan and went to see the world”. On this page it shows the grandfather in Japanese clothes and the background had very dull colours because he is still in the ‘Old World’. On the next page it shows the transition to the ‘New World’. The background colours have changed from dull to bright and he had changed into European clothes. The wave that looks very unsteady shows the ‘New World’. All this happens when you want to ‘see the world.\nQuestion 5. Discuss the attitudes and values of the text and your personal response to these.\nQuestion 6. Describe at least one link you can make between this book and another/other texts you have read or viewed. How do the texts compare in terms of the ideas presented and how do you respond to these ideas?\nOne of the pages in this book makes us realise that we often label Japan as the enemy in World War II, whilst they were also the victim and had also suffered a large amount of devastation. In the film Pearl Harbour, one of the scenes was Japan bombing Pearl Harbour. This only shows the negative side of Japan, where they were attackers, but it did not show them as the victims suffering from the disaster. This movie is persuading the audience to blame Japan for the damages of the war, where Japan had to go through the emotional breakdowns and physical injuries.\nEven though the book tells us not to blame Japan for the damages and the movie shows us that Japan was the enemy in World War II, there is still a link between the two texts and that is after a war majority of the participating countries will have, no matter large or small, havocs. I think, because of this, we should not blame a certain country for the occurrence of the war, and should not blame any country since the countries that participated are both enemies and victims of the war.\nMedusa by Carol an Duffy, Loads of Mistakes.\nHow are language and graphics used together to shape the reader's response in the Grandfather's Journey? Please provide two examples with references."}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Is the Big Tab HD tablet recommended as a family-oriented tablet by the author? Why or why not?\n\nPassage: Nabi’s kids-oriented tablets have carved out a nice space for themselves at the low-end of the market, but the brand’s new 20-inch and 24-inch devices are taking a significantly, well, bigger approach.\nAt $449.99 and $549.99 respectively, the Big Tab HD line is a sizable investment for your child’s entertainment and education. When I first got my hands on the 10.5-pound 20-inch model, my first thought was, “How will kids even pick this thing up?” The 24-inch version weighs even more at a whopping 13 pounds.\nBig Tab HD packs an Nvidia Tegra 4 CPU, 2GB of RAM, a rear-facing camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC. The operating system is based on Android 4.4, with Nabi’s Blue Morpho custom kid-friendly launcher. The 20-inch uses a 1600 x 900 resolution, while the 24-inch is 1920 x 1080.\nGiven the relatively low pixel density of the tablets, the larger display on the 20-inch version wasn’t awesome. The touchscreen also felt less responsive than normal-sized devices.\nI was curious to see how kids responded to it, so I brought it out at a couple of get-togethers with kids ranging in age from 6-14. The device was a hit, and the parents enjoyed the fact that their kids were playing together instead of just hanging out on separate screens. The group quickly found the multiplayer options in games like Fruit Ninja and air hockey, eventually deciding on a four-player tank game called Don’t Fall in the Hole as their favorite.\nPre-installed games include classics like checkers, chess, tic tac toe and hangman. You’ll also have access to Show Time – a store for movies and books from Disney, Dreamworks and more – and drawing apps that are great for doodling.\nThe tablet comes with a metal frame that doubles as a handle and a stand. It’s useful, but it adds more bulk to an already bulky setup. With the stand, you could conceivably rely on Big Tab HD as a replacement for your kids’ TV, but you’d have to find alternative sources for content instead of DVDs and satellite television.\nBig Tab HD includes a parent mode that lets you bypass the custom interface in order to use the device as a regular Android tablet. The experience was sub-par, but I did manage to do some browsing and install a few apps, including Netflix and a four-player beer pong app, from Google Play. I’d love to see tabletop gaming apps such as Settlers of Catan take advantage of the big screen, but I’m doubtful that Nabi will sell enough units to warrant custom builds from developers.\nWhile Big Tab HD succeeded at entertaining my friends’ kids, it wouldn’t be my first choice for a family-oriented tablet. I’d rather have a smaller device, like the Amazon Fire HD Kids Edition tablet, that’s easy to take to restaurants or out on road trips and flights.\nCarting out a 20-inch tablet gets kids and adults alike excited, but it also feels like more gimmick than substance. Sure, we could play a few games on it for an evening, but eventually it’d end up just collecting dust because of how heavy and cumbersome it is. If you have multiple kids that would benefit from sharing a screen, you might get enough value out of this super-sized tablet, but otherwise, I suggest you pass."}

{"prompt": "Spring has sprung, and it's time to breathe in the fresh air and celebrate all things outdoorsy. Happily, spring is the perfect season for doing crafts and getting messy, both of which can be great practice for kids with fine motor issues. Try these activities to help your kiddo build his or her motor skills while celebrating everything that's wonderful about spring.\nEven if your family doesn't celebrate Easter, decorating eggs is a really fun and relatively simple project. Use toothbrushes, paintbrushes and cotton swabs to decorate hard-boiled eggs with paint and glitter, or give kids plastic eggs to decorate with stickers, glue and jewels. Working with small objects forces kids to hone their fine motor skills.\nDigging holes and planting new seeds is another perfect fine motor activity for spring, and even apartment dwellers can do it. First, let kids finger-paint their own small flower pots. Then supervise while they fill pots with soil, add seeds, cover them with more soil and water them. Repeat this with several small pots to make your own indoor herb garden, which kids can then water regularly.\nBird seed is tiny, so handling it will always force kids to use fine motor skills. Go the old-school route by having kids smear peanut butter all over a pine cone and coating the whole thing with bird seed, or help them assemble their own bird feeders from kits and fill them with seed. Add a counting element, like asking kids to find 10 pellets that are all the same color, to force them to use their fingers or plastic tweezers to separate out the tiny pieces.\nRainy days are a regular part of spring in many parts of the country, which makes rainbows a perfect project for this time of year. Creating rainbow projects often requires fine motor skills because kids have to get a lot of different colors into a small space. Have them cut strips of paper to make rainbow wall hangings, or glue individual beads or sequins in a rainbow shape onto poster board. Based on the passage above, Can you suggest some spring activities that can help children develop their fine motor skills?"}

{"prompt": "Summarize the concept of a Warrior-Mage hero and provide examples of this character in modern literature.: Traditionally, heroes can be divided into two areas. The lower area belongs to heroes who perform small deeds. A hero of this caliber may discover the chink in the Black Knight's armor, but he would not kill him. He leaves that to the higher-level heroes. These heroes perform great deeds of heroism in the tradition of Beowulf and Saint George, slaying dragons and monsters. Above these heroes reside savior characters like Frodo, Aragorn, and Arthur, and above them are the gods. But Luke Skywalker fits none of these characteristics. He does not kill Vader or the Emperor, and he uses magic, in the form of the Force. While his weapon is a sword, the traditional weapon of a knight, it is missing the symbolic crosspiece of Arthurian knights. While he is on a journey to become a knight, he also learns to use magic.\nThroughout traditional literature there is a strong differentiation between the characters that can and cannot use magic. Wizards are able to use magic. Demons are able to use magic. Normal humans can not use it. Merlin was able to use magic as a result of being half spirit, or perhaps even half demon. Arthur, on the other hand, never uses magic. Here, in Star Wars, is the first institution of a new class of hero, the Warrior-Mage. Now this character is common throughout modern fantasy and science fiction literature. A warrior-mage, or paladin as they are sometimes cast, is a knight-like character who is capable of using magic. In Shigeru Miyamato's The Legend of Zelda, Link takes on this role with the acquisition of a magical sword and the mystical Triforce. In The Matrix all of humanity awaits the arrival of \"The One\" who can use the powers of the Matrix against the powers that be. But while this character is common today, it is very difficult to find him in works that date before the early 1900s."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the Dirtbag Challenge and the Bayview warehouse experience for us?\nGenerate according to: This weekend, I went to visit a bunch of guys coming back from their Dirtbag Challenge.\nThese guys had just gotten back from a long ride. The Dirtbag Challenge involves groups riding over 50 miles in a day, camping overnight, and riding back the next day. They have regional events all over the place. The SF guys decided to double it, and rode over 100 miles each way. Here's a post describing the event last year.\nI met a bunch of riders after the event at their huge Bayview warehouse. This place was awesome! Tons of guys working on their bikes in a communal atmosphere, beer, and did I mention beer?\nApparently people leave their project bikes there and work on them, and other folks are quick to jump in to help other riders with problems that are challenging them. That’s what motorcycles are all about: a community of cool folks rallying around the bikes that bring them together.\nI forgot my phone this time, but imagine one part biker bar, one part Folsom Street Fair (don’t look that up at work if you don’t know what it is) and a whole lot of awesome choppers.

{"prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: How did the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres fare in their recent head-to-head games?\n\nGiven material: LOS ANGELES — Yu Darvish didn’t have to be perfect on Monday. Logan Forsythe didn’t have to hit for the cycle.\nIn a game that was over early and meant little, at least they offered the announced crowd of 49,419 at Dodger Stadium a remote measure of suspense.\nDarvish took a perfect game into the fifth inning of the Dodgers’ 9-3 victory over the San Diego Padres, while Forsythe went 3 for 3 with four RBI. He finished a triple shy of the cycle.\nThe nine runs were the most the Dodgers have scored in a game since July 19, but it barely resembled a tune-up for the postseason. Three Padres pitchers – Travis Wood, Cory Mazzoni and Tim Melville – saw their earned-run averages grow to 6.71, 18.00, and 7.71 respectively. The caliber of competition can only increase.\nFor a day at least, there were plenty of confidence-builders to go around.\nAustin Barnes got a rare start at second base and hit a three-run home run against Mazzoni in the fifth inning. Forsythe hit a solo home run against Wood. Yasmani Grandal went 2 for 4 with a double – 0 for 2 as a right-handed hitter and 2 for 2 as a lefty. Every starting position player reached base at least once.\nMaybe the man with the most to build on was Darvish (10-12). In what figured to be his penultimate regular-season start, the right-hander allowed one earned run over seven innings. In nine starts as a Dodger, his ERA is 3.44.\nSince he arrived in a deadline-day trade with the Texas Rangers, Darvish’s ability to spin a baseball has been unassailable. So is his fastball, which touched 97 mph against San Diego. Darvish had been hampered by a few mechanical kinks, which the team attributed to the recovery process from his 2015 Tommy John surgery. The kinks diminished to the point where they were not a factor Monday.\n“I think I’m in really good position physically and mentally,” Darvish said through an interpreter.\nFor all his weapons as a pitcher, Darvish struggled with efficiency for much of August. His command was unpredictable. Against the Padres, Darvish did not walk a batter and struck out nine. He completed seven innings for just the third time since the trade.\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts spoke glowingly of Darvish’s rapport with pitching coach Rick Honeycutt. Not only did Darvish implement Honeycutt’s mechanical recommendations, Roberts said, the two men are on the same page when scouting opponents prior to each start.\nGrandal said the key to Darvish’s turnaround – two earned runs in his last three starts – is more fundamental.\nNo Padres reached base against Darvish until Cory Spangenberg was hit by a pitch in the fifth inning. The next batter, Hunter Renfroe, hit a double. Spangenberg scored on the play, dashing Darvish’s chance at a perfect game, a no-hitter and a shutout in less than a minute.\nBy then, however, the Dodgers had built a five-run cushion.\nMaking his first appearance since he was sent to the bullpen, right-hander Kenta Maeda allowed a pair of runs in the eighth inning. One scored on a throwing error, and the only two hits he allowed were weak infield singles.\nBeleaguered right-hander Pedro Baez allowed a pair of hits in the ninth inning but struck out three, including Austin Hedges to strand runners on second and third base to end the game.\nWith five games remaining in the regular season, the Dodgers reached 100 wins in a season for the first time since 1974. The franchise record for wins in a season is 105, set in Brooklyn in 1953. If all five of the Dodgers’ remaining games were against the Padres, they would have a better chance of tying the record.\nThere’s a more practical matter at stake. The Dodgers (100-57) moved 1½ games ahead of the idle Cleveland Indians (98-58) for the best record in Major League Baseball, with home-field advantage throughout the postseason at stake.\nThey can clinch home-field advantage through at least the National League Championship Series as early as Tuesday. Only the Washington Nationals (95-61) can catch the Dodgers now. Any two losses by Washington, or two wins by the Dodgers, would do the trick."}

You'll need special cookie cutters; or you can create your own skull and bones from cardboard and cut around them on the pastry with a knife. For the best \"puff,\" keep the pastry cold as you work.\nIn a large pot, bring broth to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes, carrots, and green beans. Cover and bring to simmering; then reduce heat and cook until carrots are tender to bite, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving broth, and set vegetables aside.\nMelt butter in pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, mushrooms, celery, thyme, rosemary, pepper, and salt. Sauté until vegetables are soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add flour and cook, stirring, until light golden, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk until blended, then add reserved broth and whisk until no lumps remain. Cook, whisking, until simmering, 10 to 12 minutes.\nRemove sauce from heat and stir in reserved vegetables and the chicken. Pour into a shallow baking dish about 9 by 13 in. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 375°. On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 pastry sheet into a rectangle 1 in. Longer and wider than baking dish. With a small knife, score a 1/2-in. Border on all sides of pastry without cutting through it. Slide pastry onto a baking sheet and chill. Re-flour work surface and roll second pastry sheet to a 10- by 12-in. Rectangle. Cut out 3 skulls, using a 5- by 3 1/2-in. Skull-shaped cookie cutter.* Cut 4 each of large and medium bones, using 4- by 1 1/2-in. And 3 1/2- by 1 1/2-in. Bone-shaped cookie cutters. Using a knife tip, score faces in skulls without cutting through pastry. Transfer skulls and bones to a baking sheet and chill until cold.\nSet chilled pastry rectangle onto cool chicken mixture, gently pushing it along score lines into edges of dish. Brush with egg. Arrange large bones on pastry and brush with egg; then arrange skulls and medium bones on top, overlapping a bit if needed, and brush with egg.\nBake until pastry is well browned, about 40 minutes; if filling starts to bubble over, put a baking sheet on lower rack under pot pie.\n*We used a skull cookie cutter and dog-bone cookie cutter set from CopperGifts.com.\nMake ahead: Through step 4, up to 1 day, filling and pastry chilled separately airtight. To continue with step 5, bring filling to room temperature, 2 hours.\nCan you suggest some alternative ingredients that can be used in the filling for this recipe, and how would they affect the overall taste and texture of the dish?"}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you summarize the key events and quotes from the recent feud between President Trump and Steve Bannon in relation to Michael Wolff's new book?\n\nPassage: President Trump on Thursday night slammed the author of an explosive new book chronicling the administration and featuring quotes from his former top aide Steve Bannon torching Trump's inner circle and family.\nThe comments came hours after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters during a briefing Thursday that Breitbart, the far-right-leaning website that Bannon returned to running after leaving the Trump administration, should consider cutting ties with him.\n\"I certainly think that it's something they should look at and consider,\" she said. On Wednesday, Trump said Bannon had \"lost his mind\" in response to his comments in the book.\nThe president then personally aired his grievances on Twitter, lashing out at Bannon as \"Sloppy Steve\" while also denying that the White House provided any access to Michael Wolff as the author and media critic wrote Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which is set to be released on Friday.\n\"I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist. Look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\" Trump tweeted.\nBreitbart News Network LLC board members are reportedly considering the White House's directives to oust Bannon. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the exchanges, reported that some on the board were supportive of removing Bannon as chairman.\nAnd Bannon's financial backers, billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah, distanced themselves from him.\n\"I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected,\" Rebekah Mercer said in a statement. \"My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements.\"\nIn Wolff's book, Bannon is quoted extensively taking shots at Trump’s inner circle and family, including Donald Trump Jr., daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner.\nThe excerpts have caused such a stir that the publisher is releasing the book on Friday, four days ahead of schedule. This came just hours after Trump's attorneys sent a cease and desist letter demanding that the title be held back, arguing Bannon allegedly violated the terms of a nondisclosure agreement signed during his time at the White House.\nAmong the many explosive details in the book, Bannon is quoted as calling the Trump Tower meeting that Trump Jr., Kushner, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort attended with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic.\"\nSince May 2017, the Russia investigation has led to the indictments of four people, including Manafort, who pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\nAt Breitbart News, the Fire and Fury excerpts, first published by the Guardian, were covered prominently without any denials or comments from Bannon himself.\nThe rebuke from the White House on Wednesday was swift.\n\"This book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Participating in a book that can only be described as trashy tabloid fiction exposes their sad desperate attempts at relevancy.\"\nOn his Sirius XM radio show later that night, Bannon had a softer tone, calling Trump \"a great man\" when responding to a caller’s question about the apparent strain between the two men.\nTrump reportedly sent Bannon a cease-and-desist letter about the \"disparaging\" comments, ABC News reported. There was talk that Bannon was considering a defamation suit against Trump, but a source close to Bannon told BuzzFeed News that was not true.\nBut according to emails obtained by BuzzFeed News, Bannon privately expressed ambivalence about Trump as a presidential candidate before taking over his campaign, calling him a \"narcissist.\"\nThe tension between Trump and Bannon has been escalating since August, when Bannon left amid a tumultuous time at the White House. Since then, he has used his pulpit as head of Breitbart to target those as insufficiently conservative to be in the Trump administration, at times taking aim at the president himself."}

{"prompt": "Can you tell me more about the best spots to catch panfish and what kind of bait to use? Answer according to: Lake Mohave is not producing much in the way of our stripped bass. There is some largemouth and smallmouth bass action. The coves around the dam and near the power lines are producing some largemouth bass while the shelves are having some smallies going after mostly plastics the dark hula tails and the pumpkin color are working well. The panfish bite is doing well but not of much size. However going down river below the Davis Dam along the Colorado river near and below the gorge you will find some great panfish activity. Pan fish, or also called bluegill, redear and sunfish in our neck of the woods, so to say. Our anglers Joel Pyne (black shirt) and Steve Jansen are showing about 25 they landed from their boat. These fish are best found in the plant life areas along the shorelines. A little closer to home and back up river along the casino row you can find some striper action. Ernie and son Kayden Calma were able to bring in these stripers, with the larger one at 2.84 pounds and 201/2 inches and one of the other larger ones at 1.90 pounds and 17 and 1/4 inches. This father and son team were using lures. They were having best luck with Savage Gear hard baits in a white swim pattern. I have been hearing that the striper bite is doing well just below community park and above the big bend area. Rotary Park is a go to spot for you trout anglers. We are getting more rainbow trout here the first part of October. With that being said we hope to see you soon and remember the limit of trout is 5 below the Davis Dam. These trout are being brought to us from the Willow Beach National Fish Hatchery; this is a federal hatchery and they are up and running and it looks like its going to be a great trout season. Thanks for your support and ice that catch down to bring in and share."}

{"prompt": "Russian officials have expressed their sharp criticism towards the U.S. Plans for the so-called \"Prompt Global Strike\" initiative. Are they justified?\nWhat does this \"Prompt Global Strike\" represent, how can it interfere with the Russian plans and how can it be opposed?\nThe U.S. Military adopted the concept of the Prompt Global Strike (PGS) during the 2000s. The basis of the idea is the ability to make a non-nuclear attack anywhere in the world within an hour after a decision is made to strike.\nHow can we solve this problem? The first components of PGS, the most realistic in its execution, are conventional intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with high-precision, non-nuclear warheads.\nThe second component of PGS facilities can be strategic cruise missiles with hypersonic speeds. The third component of PGS is kinetic weapons, or “wands of the Lord,” which is the ironic nickname for this weapon, widely described in fiction but still not implemented in practice.\nThe United States is not making the PGS targets a secret; they have been described in Pentagon statements. But who are the PGS facilities created for? First, they are mobile and stationary ballistic missile launchers, command centers and other nuclear facilities.\nSecondly, they are \"facilities isolating military operations” – launchers of tactical missiles as well as antiaircraft missiles, obstructing the standard air-ground or air-sea operations.\nThirdly, it is the terrorist infrastructure – in this case the use of PGS is not any different from the strikes made from unmanned aircrafts.\nChina, North Korea and Iran are named as the owners of this infrastructure, and in the third paragraph it says that it is \"international terrorism.\"\nAt the same time, Russia has many facilities isolating military operations, as well as mobile missile launchers, and therefore it cannot be excluded from the list of possible PGS targets.\nIt is clear that a similar attack is fraught with risks of nuclear escalation and full-scale retaliation against the United States. However, on the basis of this sole thesis, it is impossible to conclude that PGS does not threaten Russia.\nThe biggest part of PGS is, of course, the ballistic missiles equipped with precision nonnuclear warheads. The idea was one of the first ones, and it was also one of the last ones to become the subject of skepticism.\nIn fact, the non-nuclear ICBMs have a number of drawbacks. Mainly because all the systems of missile warning and missile defense information tools are detected as this type of objects (as well as warheads after their division).\nAnd if this does not matter during operations conducted as PGS against a third world country, as soon as it comes to a potential enemy such as Russia or even China, things get much worse.\nIt does not say on the intercontinental missile which equipment it has, and, strictly speaking, during a the mass start of such missiles any country’s government has all the capabilities of organizing a retaliatory strike, i.e. Of launching their missiles (already with the nuclear equipment), without waiting for the arrival of unexpected guests.\nFrom the point of view of the principles of nuclear strategy and international security in general, this is a very bad option, hence the reaction of the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\"If we are talking about existing ballistic carriers with conventional equipment, it is clearly the path to the escalation of the conflict with the hardest, in fact, apocalyptic consequences,\" said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.\nThat is why the main focus of development of PGS facilities was redirected to the hypersonic aircraft. This topic is more complex in terms of its engineering and physical design and implementation process, however, the resulting facilities are more flexible, versatile and more promising.\nIt is necessary to understand the capabilities of modern air defense systems. The Top Russian ADMS – S-300PMU-2 Favorit and S-400, are capable of striking targets moving at speeds of up to 2,800 and up to 4,500 meter per second, respectively.\nThis is on a hypersonic level, however, the same prototype of Falcon HTV-2 attains a speed of up to 7,800 meter per second, which is comparable with speeds of military intercontinental missiles at the terminal stage of their trajectory.\nAs for the facilities of the kinetic destruction, the question of their deployment and a creation of defense facilities against them cannot be solved tomorrow. In any case, the orbiting of such systems will trigger a new arms race, coupled with the creation of space-based weapons, and possibly a return to the orbital system of nuclear bombing, the first samples of which were tested in the late ‘60s and subsequently prohibited by the 1979 SALT 2 Treaty.\nIn the conditions of reducing the threat of global nuclear war since 1991 and, at the same time, a distinct lowering of the threshold for using tactical nuclear weapons, the full deployment of PGS can significantly complicate the maintenance of strategic stability. This explains the sharp reaction of the Russian Foreign Ministry.\nHow does the development of hypersonic aircraft impact the implementation of PGS, and what are some of the challenges in defending against such systems?"}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What are the Republicans considering in regards to Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi probe?\n\nPassage: Issa's new effort on Benghazi probe: a subpoena for Hillary Clinton?\nRepublicans have accused Mullen and Pickering of protecting [former Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton in their report by not citing her for any breaches of leadership. By pushing back at their report — both at the methods and the content — Republicans hope to erode one of the biggest defenses of Clinton.\nDemocrats tell Politico that the testimony of Pickering and Mullen will vindicate the ARB, but that seems unlikely. Pickering himself admitted that he only interviewed lower-level State officials because he had decided beforehand where the blame should be fixed, telling Bob Schieffer in May, “We knew where the responsibility rested.” The ARB ignored Undersecretary Patrick Kennedy, who made decisions on consulate security, but who also was a key aide to the Clintons during Bill Clinton’s presidency and during all of Hillary Clinton’s tenure at State.\nRepublicans are mulling whether to demand former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s return to Capitol Hill to face more tough questions about her agency’s failure to protect diplomats and security staff in Benghazi, Libya a year ago.\nAn aide to a high-ranking GOP member of the House Oversight and Government Affairs committee told MailOnline that the committee’s chairman, California Rep. Darrell Issa, ‘is dead serious’ about raking the likely 2016 presidential candidate over the coals in the future.\nIssa told the Fox News Channel on Wednesday morning that his committee won’t hesitate to bring back any of the senior-level witnesses who have already testified about the September 11, 2012 terror attack on American diplomatic facilities in the eastern Libya port city.\nAnd that includes Hillary Clinton.\nIssa sounds less inclined to issue a subpoena than to force Hillary back to the panel on her own volition. Undermining the ARB report will be a first step, and I’d expect that Issa has confidence in his ability to do that. Otherwise, he’d skip calling Pickering and Mullen and just focus on the CIA survivors, who will eventually get subpoenaed to testify. With the previous testimony from State Department whistleblowers in hand, Issa will next aim at Kennedy — and will be bolstered in that effort by an independent review that named Kennedy as a responsible party, unlike the ARB, a discrepancy that Issa will no doubt highlight.\nIf they build the case all the way to Kennedy, that will put a lot of public pressure on Hillary to make an appearance at the Oversight hearings, which takes the onus off of Republicans to issue a subpoena. At that point, Issa will issue a public invitation to Hillary to address the issues that have arisen from a multitude of sources about the incompetence and deceit at State during her tenure. If she refuses to appear, that’s not going to look good, regardless of whether she wants to run for office later or not. It won’t prevent Oversight from making a damning case about her leadership at State, either."}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposal for old city buildings, and how will it benefit the city's environment?\n\nPassage: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently made waves when he proposed energy efficiency improvements for old city buildings spewing pollutants. Some cities already require similar upgrades when properties are sold, but de Blasio’s proposal is unique: it applies to all buildings, for sale or not.\nThis new initiative, brought forth in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, should establish the city as a leader in environmental efforts.\nThe new proposal underscores that the time is right for energy retrofits, if not to save the planet then at least to save money for property owners and add value upon sale.\nWhen it comes to the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the numbers add up. In New York, the 14,500 buildings — out of a total of about 1 million citywide — targeted by de Blasio’s proposal blast out a full 24 percent of the Big Apple’s greenhouse gas emissions.\nEven if reducing greenhouse gases is not a priority for property owners, the bottom line benefits of an energy retrofit can be substantial, especially for older buildings.\nSuch is the case for New York’s 87-year-old Empire State Building, which underwent a holistic energy efficiency upgrade in 2011 and has saved millions annually since. The retrofit involved all 6,514 windows of the 102-story building.\nRelatively speaking, homeowners can also realize significant savings from retrofits, along with the added bonus of improvements in comfort level and indoor air quality.\nRetrofits can also add resale value. Attic insulation, for example, “more than paid for itself” in a majority of the markets surveyed by Remodeling Magazine last year.\n”You can put bells and whistles in a poorly performing building and what you have is a poorly performing building with bells and whistles,” he cautioned.\nNext comes upgrading HVAC equipment and major appliances. Jones advises homeowners to be careful not to overlook a water heater upgrade. Water heaters are the number one item people take for granted, he said. Usually when they give out, people are desperate to replace them, but they are the second or third largest energy user in the house, he explained.\nDespite the clear long-term savings, motivating property owners to invest money up front in energy retrofits is still a challenge.\nFortunately, new emerging financing options are making it easy for commercial builders to go the environmentally-friendly route.\nFor example, Energy Savings Performance Contracts provide for retrofits with no costs up front. The contractor receives payment based on the value of the energy saved.\nNew incentives for homeowners are also beginning to emerge, some of which are tied to upgrade mandates such as de Blasio’s proposal, which provides low interest, long-term financing among other incentives.\nEnergy efficient mortgages are another new instrument that eliminates the initial economic sting from a homeowner’s decision to invest in a retrofit.\nAs Jones says, the internet is providing property sellers and buyers new tools for researching retrofit costs and comparing home values, and property owners stand to make big bottom line gains by using it.\nTina Casey has been writing about sustainability, alternative energy and energy efficiency since 2009. Her articles appear regularly in CleanTechnica.com, where she is a senior reporter, and TriplePundit.com. Follow her on Twitter."}

{"prompt": "An Oshkosh Democrat is emerging as a potential replacement for Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, who announced he was stepping down Thursday.\nMADISON - Oshkosh Democrat Gordon Hintz said Friday he would run to replace Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, who announced this week he was stepping down.\nIn an interview, Hintz said that Democrats have to communicate to voters from rural regions to Milwaukee how his party can make their lives better.\n\"I'm a believer in a broad appeal,\" said Hintz, a member of the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee. \"I think Democrats can explain what they're doing to provide opportunity.\"\nHintz would be the first new leader for Assembly Democrats during the tenure of Gov. Scott Walker, a period in which Republicans have racked up victory after victory on the legislative floor and at the ballot box.\nSeveral other Democrats, including Rep. Chris Taylor of Madison, have been mentioned as potential candidates but so far none has committed to a run.\nTaylor said Friday that she would not run for the post, saying she was \"excited to support Gordon Hintz.\" Rep. Evan Goyke (D-Milwaukee), who unsuccessfully challenged Barca in 2014, said Friday he was also backing Hintz.\nBarca, a former congressman from Kenosha, announced Thursday he was leaving his leadership post after a lengthy private meeting of Assembly Democrats outside the state Capitol. Barca has been in the role for 6½ years — a challenging period for his party.\nThose involved in and familiar with the discussions said fellow Democrats told Barca Thursday that they had become frustrated with him, with some showing a willingness to quickly vote on whether to keep him as their leader.\nThe challenge to Barca's leadership followed his decision last month to vote for a deal struck by Walker with Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwanese company that has agreed to build an up to $10 billion plant near Barca's district. The flat-screen display plant could employ thousands in exchange for up to $2.85 billion in cash from Wisconsin taxpayers.\nMost Democrats — including Hintz — oppose the package because of its price tag and because of provisions in the deal that would exempt the company from some environmental rules.\n\"This afternoon I made the very difficult decision to step down as leader of the Assembly following deliberate, thoughtful discussions,\" Barca said in a statement Thursday. \"We ended our discussion this afternoon with a very constructive strategy session and are very focused on the work we must do to improve Gov. (Scott) Walker's short-sighted budget.\"\nMany of Barca's colleagues were comfortable with his support for the Foxconn package but were bothered by how closely he had worked with Republican leaders on the issue, said one person familiar with Thursday's meeting. That person and others spoke on the condition they not be named because of the sensitivity of the meeting.\nWalker tweaked Democrats in a tweet Friday that touted the up to 13,000 jobs that could come out of Foxconn's liquid display factory.\nAt the ballot box, Barca had little to no success in winning legislative seats in districts that were drawn by Republicans. In November, Republicans won a 64-35 seat majority in the Assembly, their largest in that house since 1957.\nBarca had played a prominent role in leading Democrats in his house during the massive 2011 labor protests against Walker’s legislation repealing most collective bargaining for most public employees. The Democratic leader marshaled a more than 61-hour continuous floor debate in an unsuccessful effort to kill the bill.\nToward the end of that debate, Hintz reacted to a vote by telling then GOP Rep. Michelle Litjens that she was \"(expletive) dead,\" a statement that Litjens later said she took to be a political threat rather than a personal one. Hintz later apologized to Litjens, who is now engaged to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester).\nOnly days before that February 2011 incident, Hintz had been cited by Appleton police in connection with an investigation of the Heavenly Touch Massage Parlor there for prostitution. Hintz pleaded no contest to the citation and apologized for the incident at the time, calling it a \"bad decision in my personal life that was out of character for me.\"\nCould there be an air guitar solo to celebrate a successful leadership bid?\n“It is always there if needed,” Hintz said by text message. Based on the passage above, Who is running to replace Peter Barca as Assembly Minority Leader and what is their stance on appealing to voters from different regions?"}

{"prompt": "Given the text: The Mirror’s phone-hacking lawyers have reportedly described the fees charged by their opponents as “wholly disproportionate”.\nAnd reporting from a costs hearing ahead of a two-week trial set for February, The Guardian said the High Court judge “appeared to agree” after being presented with details.\nThe hearing was for a trial in which Sven-Goran Eriksson, Christopher Eccleston, Shobna Gulati, Alan Yentob, Garry Flitcroft, Abbie Gibson and two others, not named by the paper, are suing MGN.\nThe Guardian reported that Mirror Group Newspapers’ skeleton argument states that one of the claimants’ QCs wanted to earn £335,250 during the trial.\nTrinity Mirror has set aside £4m for phone-hacking costs, but in court it said that this could triple if the claimants win their cases. The paper reported MGN was planning to spend £1m on this trial.\nIn its skeleton argument over costs, the publisher said the celebrities would have “no interest in the costs being charged by their respective lawyers” because of their “no win, no fee” arrangements. MGN does not have this agreement.\nAccording to The Guardian, Mr Justice Mann “appeared to agree” with MGN when it highlighted the costs and number of barristers – four – acting for the claimants and described this as “plainly disproportionate”.\nThe judge said: “Is any of this litigation proportionate? At one level, all these costs are disproportionate for the claims being brought….\nBenjamin Williams, for MGN, rejected suggestions he client’s costs were “strategically low”.\nAccording to The Guardian, there are 43 alleged victims of Mirror phone-hacking known to the court.

{"prompt": "Influencer marketing is red-hot right now. Whether you realize it or not, a material percentage of your Instagram feed today is probably content posted by people getting paid….a lot. It’s not unheard of for the platform’s most popular accounts to get paid over $100,000 per post, and major brands collectively are spending an estimated $255 million per month on sponsored posts on Instagram alone.\nWhy will brands pay this much? Because it works. But for the most part influencer marketing is still only being used by big brands, because the infrastructure just isn’t there yet to let the smaller guys participate.\nMeet Dovetale, an influencer marketing platform built for the masses. The company is one of the first to graduate from Expa Labs, an offshoot of Expa, the New York and San Francisco-based startup studio founded by Uber co-founder Garrett Camp in 2014.\nDovetale’s platform lets brands and agencies do four main things: discover, manage, measure and pay influencers for branded content. Essentially they want to provide a self-service platform that consolidates the manual steps brands typically have to take in order to find and work with an influencer.\nDiscover is exactly what it sounds like – the tool lets you specify parameters like follower count, audience location and demographic so you can find influencers whose posts will be seen by the exact demographic you want to advertise to. Combined these parameters will let you do something like say I need a personal trainer who has 20,000 followers who are mostly under 21, and live in the U.S. Previously brands and agencies would have to search manually through databases of influencers – Dovetale wants to make it as easy as a Google search.\nWithin Discover also a cool feature called recommendations that lets you upload an image you like, and Dovetale will use image recognition and machine learning to crawl the web looking for other influencers who post content like the kind you uploaded – even if they aren’t already in Dovetale’s database of influencers.\nMeasure is how the startup shows brands how their posts are performing. After specifying which posts were sponsored by you, Dovetale will tell you how many times it was liked, commented on, etc – so you can track and graph engagement over time and compare it between posts.\nLastly, Manage and Pay are designed to help brands manage influencers during and after campaigns. You can see a list of all the influencers you work with, what their current “reach” is, and even distribute a one-time payment for a campaign. Dovetale uses Stripe and charges 2.5% on all transfers, and is even working to provide all influencers with a 1099 tax form so you don’t have to worry about it.\nDovetale charges brands and agencies monthly for use of the entire platform, with three plans costing $199, $499, or $999 per month. The only differentiator is that the least expensive option doesn’t include demographic analytics (so you’d have to manually choose which influencers you think best fit your audience). $199 tier also only includes 25 monthly “recommendations”, which is the processing-heavy image recognition that searches for influencers outside of Dovetale’s database.\nWhile $199 may seem like a lot, it’s important to understand that this monthly fee essentially lets a small brand work with influencers across every social platform – something that used to require an advertising agency or big in-house marketing team to accomplish. Now anyone from an Etsy jewelry shop to a new coffee shop in Brooklyn can get access to high-quality influencers that will work to drive audiences to their brand.

And “Was the diagnosis even correct?” These comments, more often than not, have been met with sympathetic looks or avoidance of eye contact altogether, making me more angry and determined to boot Autism the hell out. Those of you who have housed Autism for years probably think I’m ridiculous. Two years ago, when we received the formal declaration that Autism was making itself a permanent resident in our home, I did everything I could to make it comfortable. Hours of research, reading, phone calls, therapy sessions, doctor’s visits, and social skills classes ensured we could co-exist. We got used to, even comfortable with, each other. I found myself forgetting Autism was around. I stopped giving it attention. Books got dusty, testing stopped, therapies started to wane, my writing came to an abrupt halt. It would whisper in my ear at night, sometimes slipping casually into conversation with acquaintances and co-workers. It would manifest itself in my students, or appear on TV. It would proclaim itself loudly in the words of therapists and teachers and principals. It would blindside me in books read purposefully for escape. It defied my denial; it demanded my awe. It reminds me of it constantly. Autism likes to argue with me, rigidly refusing when it feels I have lied. Autism likes to scream and hit and sometimes bite. Autism doesn’t like to look me in the eye. Making it nearly impossible for him to understand his peers. Autism likes to make my son feel overwhelmed, causing him to swing his arms and bump into walls. Autism likes to make my son feel clumsy when he can’t catch a ball. Autism likes to make my son feel stupid when he can’t get things right the first time. Autism makes my son cry. If I say the word enough, will it lose some of its power? We never know the words we will collect along the way, the ones which will forever reside within us. Autism is one of mine. I’m sure you carry your own. Autism: a mental condition, present from early childhood, characterized by difficulty in communicating and forming relationships with other people and in using language and abstract concepts. A resident in my five-year-old’s mind. And I am still adjusting. This story was originally published on Miranda’s blog Mommy Catharsis.

{"prompt": "IRVINE — The first photo book cataloging the historic Irvine Ranch captures a \"sense of freedom,\" Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren said at a book-release party last week.\nThe 208-page book, \"Southern California Coastal Mountains to the Sea: A Celebration of Open Space Land on the Historic Irvine Ranch,\" by American West photographer David R. Stoecklein was published by the Irvine Co. As part of the Newport Beach-based developer's effort to preserve 50,000 acres of the 93,000-acre Irvine Ranch.\n\"Some of my fondest memories are of the Southern California mountains,\" Bren said to various officials and open-space supporters gathered Thursday afternoon under a shady canopy of trees at Bommer Canyon's rustic Cattle Camp. \"Whether on foot or on a bike, the open space provided a sense of freedom — freedom which I believe can only be experienced in the midst of nature. And it's that sense of real freedom that we want to share with the people of Orange County.\"\nThe book contains more than 150 color photos and was shot by Stoecklein between February and July. It traverses the diverse landscapes interconnecting the 22-mile, mountains-to-the-sea trail.\nThe trail connects Crystal Cove, Newport Beach, Weir Canyon and Anaheim Hills, a span with diverse geography that includes grasslands, oak woodlands, sandy beaches and canyons.\n\"The real challenge for me was to capture the personality of the ranch, and the personality of a landscape becomes its landmarks, wildlife and whatever nature has to offer,\" Stoecklein said before the event. \"And to show the people, the community surrounding this massive park, what is inside this massive park and where they are living.\"\nMore than three million people reside within 30 minutes of the ranch and more than one million visitors took part in programs last year led by the Irvine Ranch Conservancy, the land steward organization formed by the Irvine Co. In 2005.\n\"This book will help bring awareness to people of what a great resource is here,\" said Fran Mainella, a former National Park Service director, \"and hopefully entice people of all ages to come out and enjoy this great resource.\"\nIn particular, for residents adjacent to the park, it can be all too easy to forget what's in \"your own backyard,\" she said.\nIn June 2010, the last of the preserved lands — a 20,000-acre parcel in the easternmost area of the ranch — was transferred from the Irvine Co. To the county.\nThe lands are recognized twice-over as a natural landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the state.\n\"My longtime dream has been for the Irvine Ranch to be known for what has been preserved and protected here, as compared to what has been carefully built on these lands,\" Bren said.\nThe book retails at $47.50 and can be purchased at http://www.coastalmountainstothesea.com.\nProceeds from the book will benefit the Irvine Ranch Conservancy.

{"prompt": "What is the reason for adding liquid ingredients first when making bread in a machine?\nGenerate according to: With the price of a daily loaf of bread rising higher than the dough in the oven, the bread making machine has become an important home appliance in many kitchens across the world. To get that perfect loaf of bread you will need to add a variety of ingredients into the pan (often positioned at the bottom). The solid ingredients go on top, which means you will need to add the liquid in first on the bottom.\nThis order is an important part of bread making because the yeast will react with the water, so it’s imperative to keep these two elements apart until you are ready to go. It often takes around three hours for one loaf to be made and the ingredients are mashed into dough by a series of moving paddles. Next, the bread making machine will reach an ideal temperature that makes it ready for the baking. Do remember that because bread making machines do not add preservatives like the big manufacturers do, your bread will only last a few days before its shelf life expires.\nThe most popular and best bread machine recipes are standard dinner rolls made from country white bread. These rolls make an ideal lunch bun when you add a slice of ham or an egg mayonnaise mix in. But the best bread machine recipes are the ones which serve a wide variety of purposes. Home made burger rolls and buns are ideal to use fore barbeques or a kid’s lunchtime snack and basic French bread is also very easy to make.\nIf you are looking for something like the best bread machine recipe with a more Mediterranean touch then try the pizza bread recipes but most Europeans will agree that the French bread recipe is the best bread machine recipe for taste, simplicity and quickness when baking in your bread making machine.\nMaking French bread requires water, flour, salt and dry yeast. Pour the water in first (about one and a half cups) then add two cups of flour and a tea spoon full of salt, then pour on another half a cup of flour before putting the dry yeast (about two and a half tea spoons full) on top. Use the normal or rapid speed cycle on your bread making machine and cook for 3 hours and 5 minutes for the best bread machine recipe you will ever taste."}

{"prompt": "Here is a piece of text: A new summary analysis discovers an individual can improve two health behaviors concurrently — rebuffing the contention that embarking on a smoking cessation program will ruin a woman’s effort to lose weight.\nMany women believe nicotine suppresses the appetite and boosts metabolism and would rather take the health risks associated with smoking rather than being overweight.\nBut a new meta-analysis (results of several studies) shows that women who quit smoking while receiving treatment for weight control are better able to control their weight gain and are more successful at quitting cigarettes.\nThe finding disproves current clinical guidelines that say trying to diet and quit smoking at the same time will sabotage efforts to ditch cigarettes.\nPreviously, it was assumed that a person could only change one health risk behavior at a time. “But these findings show that, at least in the case of smoking and eating, you actually get an added benefit when you try to change a couple of behaviors at once,” Spring said.\nRecently published in the journal Addiction, Spring’s paper examined the results from 2,233 smokers in 10 studies from 1991 to 2007.\nThe study showed that women whose treatment addressed both smoking and weight control were 29 percent more likely to quit smoking in the short term (at three months) and 23 percent in the long term (from six to 14 months) than those whose treatment addressed only smoking.\nWomen whose treatment included smoking and weight control also gained less weight than those whose treatment included only smoking. They gained an average of 2.1 pounds less in the short term and 2.5 pounds less in the long term.\nSpring hopes the study results will change doctors’ attitudes and current clinical guidelines about combining weight control and smoking cessation.\n“Perhaps this news also will encourage more women to quit,” she added, noting that cigarette smoking kills an estimated 178,000 women in the U.S. Each year. About 17.4 percent of women in the U.S. Smoke.\nHer meta-analysis looked at different kinds of approaches to weight control.\nMore studies also are needed that offer longer-term intervention for weight and smoking cessation. The literature on weight control shows patients lose the benefit when they stop treatment, Spring pointed out.\n“We’re in the right ballpark, we just need to refine our pitch,” she said.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: According to the study, how much less weight did women who received treatment for both smoking and weight control gain compared to those who received treatment for smoking only?"}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Summarize the main points of the article.\n\nPassage: CARACAS, Venezuela – Twenty-five people were killed during a prison riot and dozens were wounded when two groups of inmates waged a gunbattle inside the penitentiary while hundreds of relatives were visiting, Venezuelan officials said Monday.\nThe violence erupted at Yare I prison south of Caracas on Sunday, and at least one of those slain was a relative of an inmate, said Iris Varela, the government&apos;s prisons minister.\nIt was the latest and one of the deadliest in a series of bloody clashes that have flared in Venezuela&apos;s overcrowded prisons and become a major problem for President Hugo Chavez&apos;s government.\nVarela told state television Monday afternoon that 17 of the 25 dead had been identified so far. She said some of them had been shot in the head. Forty-three other people were wounded, including 29 inmates and 14 visiting relatives, Varela said.\nAbout 980 women who were at the prison to see inmates when the fighting broke out were still inside, she said.\nArmed inmates still held control of the prison Monday night, and some of the relatives stayed inside due to fears about how security forces outside would react, said Humberto Prado, an activist and director of the watchdog group Venezuelan Prisons Observatory.\nVarela indicated the situation had stabilized Monday and said authorities planned to talk with inmates \"to try to impose order there.\"\nVarela said the riot apparently began when a gun went off while armed inmates were talking in a workshop and administrative area. She said those behind the killings \"are going to have to answer for this.\"\nCarlos Nieto, an activist who monitors human rights in Venezuelan prisons, said the gunbattle lasted about four hours and involved groups fighting for control.\nYajaira Morroy, the mother of a 27-year-old inmate at the prison, said her son suffered a gunshot wound in a leg and had been trying to help a relative of another inmate who was wounded and then died. She said her son managed to reach a guard post and was taken to a hospital.\nMorroy said during a telephone interview that the situation inside the prison had calmed and that some relatives who had been stranded inside were able to come out. But she said that armed inmates were in control and that National Guard troops had not gone inside.\nOutside the prison, inmates&apos; relatives wept while they waited for word about the men inside.\nViolence has recently worsened inside Venezuela&apos;s prisons, where inmates often obtain weapons and drugs with the help of corrupt guards.\nNieto said the riot shows that the \"most serious prison problem, the weapons possessed by inmates, hasn&apos;t been solved.\" He noted that less than a month ago, another bloody riot erupted at another prison in Merida state. While officials said the death toll was 11, the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory said it had reports that about 30 people were killed.\nNationwide, the group says that 560 people were killed in Venezuelan prisons last year and that the pace of the violence increased during the first half of this year, with at least 304 inmates killed.\nVenezuela currently has 33 prisons built to hold about 12,000 inmates, but officials have said the prisons&apos; population is about 47,000.\nMore than 3,000 inmates fill Yare I prison, which was built to hold 750, according to the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory.\nFollowing a deadly armed uprising last year in the prisons El Rodeo I and El Rodeo II, just outside Caracas, Chavez announced plans for changes to the country&apos;s troubled penal system including building new prisons, improving conditions and speeding trials for inmates who have yet to be sentenced.\nSince then, Chavez has approved funds to repair and renovate prisons. Varela has said the government has started activities for inmates, allowing them to attend classes and to prepare food that they sell.\nChavez&apos;s political opponents and groups that monitor inmate rights have criticized the government&apos;s response as inadequate, and outbursts of violence have continued, becoming a campaign issue ahead of the country&apos;s Oct. 7 presidential election.\nOpposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles lambasted the government&apos;s efforts in a message on Twitter Monday, noting that hundreds of inmates have been killed since Chavez created a new ministry to oversee prison issues last year. Capriles called Chavez&apos;s pledges to improve the prison system \"another big lie.\"\nIn one case in May, the government shut down Caracas&apos; La Planta lockup and moved inmates to other prisons following a three-week uprising that pitted armed inmates against troops. Officials said that two people were killed in the gunfire, including a man who lived near the prison and was hit by a stray bullet, and that five others were wounded."}

{"prompt": "There was a time that we had pizza every Friday night. So much so that when I would make out our weekly menu, Caleb would always say that Tacos are Thursdays and pizza if Friday dinner.\nFor some reason we got away from the pizza night. But pizza is one of Caleb’s favorite things to eat.\nWhen I found this recipe I thought to myself, if I tell him it’s pizza, which it really is, he’ll like it. It may look a little different, but it is called “pizza”.\nThis was messy and fun to make. I didn’t have an oven safe pan so I used a glass baking dish instead. I was going to wrap tin foil around the handle, but thought better be safe than sorry!\nPreparation: Preheat oven as per directions on dough. With a sharp knife, divide each biscuit into 4. In a large bowl, combine diced biscuit dough, sauce, 1 1/2 cups cheese and toppings. Stir to combine.\nPour mixture into greased oven safe skillet or 9×13 baking pan. Chiffonade the basil and sprinkle on top along with remaining cheese. Bake according to directions on dough, checking to make sure dough is cooked through and cheese is bubbling (I always bake mine for an additional 5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.\nI think the best part of cooking dinner is that you include the kids with what you’re making. They love to be a part of what they eat. And it makes them feel proud!\nWhen this came out of the oven, Brooklyn actually asked why it looked so “bubbly”. Caleb said this sure doesn’t look like pizza, but they both ate it and they both asked for more!\nI’ve been seeing commercials for this mozzarella cheese that comes in a sheet, and thought that was just waiting for me to get creative. I also have a cherry tomato plant that is going crazy right now, so I wanted to incorporate them as well. These little wraps were fairly easy to make, but my little cheese roll did not unwrap as easily as they show in the commercial!\nMix the olive oil, basil and garlic in a small bowl. Unroll the mozzarella cheese, spread with oil mixture and top with the sliced tomatoes. Roll the cheese back up, and slice into about 1/2 inch slices.\nThese didn’t want to stay together on their own accord, so I used toothpicks to hold them together until we were ready to eat. They were good, but I didn’t like the texture of this roll cheese as much as regular fresh mozzarella, it felt a little rubbery to me. How did the children react to the pizza made with diced biscuit dough instead of traditional pizza dough?"}

{"prompt": "When we are swimming in produce, I find a dish to combine everything we have on hand. Today I have sourdough, peaches, blueberries & eggs - time for bread pudding!\nmethod: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-11-inch ceramic baking dish.\n2. In a medium saucepan combine the butter, milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, & cinnamon, and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts and the milk is hot. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.\n3. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and then whisk them steadily into the milk mixture. Continue whisking until blended. Counting to 125 usually ensures well blended eggs.\n4. Combine the peaches, blueberries, and bread in a large bowl and mix well. Transfer to the baking dish and pour the liquid mixture evenly over the top. Make sure all of the bread pieces are soaked with the mixture, and let sit for 5 minutes. Pressing down with a spatula helps here!\n5. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until bubbly and brown. Serve warm but not hot.

You can start kissing goodbye to the Premier League.\nThe Sea-sliders are unable to claw away from fellow strugglers Wigan and only goal difference keeps Ian Holloway’s men out of the relegation zone.\nAnd that’s a crying shame for the side everyone has loved to watch this season.\nHolloway had pinned his hopes of securing another season of big-time football on his side coming good in their four successive games at Bloomfield Road in April.\nBut home definitely isn’t where the heart is as those matches earned Ollie’s men just two miserable points. Not the return he was looking for.\nTottenham are up next, with Bolton and Manchester United to follow.\nMaximum points from those games are just about as likely as the donkeys on Blackpool beach being put out to pasture.\nBut Holloway, being Holloway, won’t throw in the towel. Why should he when there are those three crucial clashes left?\nHe said: “Yes, there is a belief we can stay in this league. I feel that belief comes from our group of lads. And our fans were terrific today, too.\nHis close pal, Stoke boss Tony Pulis, is also rooting for Ollie (below) to pull off the great escape.\nHe said: “They are fighting for their lives and you have to give them credit. It was a tough game and a tough place to come to.\nFA Cup finalists Stoke battled from the start and deservedly held on for a point – the first time neither side has scored in a league game at Blackpool this season.\nThere were constant reminders during the bore draw that there would be an official unveiling of a statue to honour legend Jimmy Armfield tonight.\nThat tribute to a great man posed just about the same amount of threat as his successors on the pitch. It was a depressing day by the seaside. A day when Blackpool cried out for a touch of class – but there was none to be found.\nEveryone should have been handed a neck brace on arrival with so many balls being hoisted high into the Blackpool sunshine.\nSome with purpose. Most with no intent.\nBit like the football, really. It was all hit and miss as Blackpool went in search of goals in the first half – but they always failed miserably with the final ball.\nIn complete contrast, Stoke created chances. That man Rory Delap caused widespread panic with one of his trademark long throws, which keeper Matt Gilks flapped at.\nPotters defender Robert Huth was on the loose ball in a flash and powered a shot towards goal, which Stephen Crainey managed to boot off the line.\nThe home side came back huffing and puffing but were caught out once more when Kenwyne Jones drove towards goal, before being stopped in his tracks by Ian Evatt.\nAnd, on the stroke of half-time, Jones was put clean through by Glenn Whelan.\nThe striker rounded Gilks but then somehow side-footed wide with the goal at his mercy.\nIt was a huge break for Blackpool and the half-time whistle was a welcome relief for Holloway’s men.\nThe Seasiders then came close to breaking the deadlock just seconds after the break.\nCharlie Adam, the man who’s been at the centre of everything good about Blackpool this season, fired in a low corner and Matt Phillips poked just wide.\nKeith Southern then thought he’d done the business when he left fly, only to see his shot zip past the post.\nWhelan had similar ideas when he whipped in a swerving shot from all of 30 yards – but Gilks palmed the ball away to safety.\nAnd the Stoke midfielder came close again with eight minutes left when another strike of his fizzed past the upright.\nStory of the day, really. And there won’t be many days left for Blackpool in the Premier League if they carry on like this."}

{"prompt": "Here is a piece of text: Summer monsoons are the lifeblood of Indian agriculture.\nBeginning with the initial burst in May or June and culminating in steady rainfall through September, monsoons supply a vital resource to reservoirs and much of the peninsula's farmlands.\nWithout this rain, the country would struggle to provide for it's 1.3 billion people, who are one of the world's top consumers and producers of crops like wheat and rice. Predicting monsoons helps farmers determine when and how to work their land.\nFor nearly a century, India has turned to an old statistical method to forecast and prepare for these seasonal downpours. This method is better than nothing but hardly perfect - offering only an overall, country-wide forecast and forecasts for five regions. For a country as large as India, these scattered predictions aren't exactly descriptive.\nIn an effort to work better with the weather, India will abandon the statistical method and instead adopt a $60 million supercomputer with 3D modeling to help predict next year's monsoons, reports Reuters.\nThe dynamic, 3D modeling technique is far more high-tech than the statistical method, which sees Indian meteorologists collect data on things like sea-surface temperatures, wind direction, and wind speed before comparing this information to historical records of rainfall.\nThe task is tedious but tends to be reliable. Last year, despite forecasts of rainfall by India's only private forecaster, the India Meteoritical Department (IMD) correctly predicted a drought for the second year in a row using the statistical method. Still, the method's faults were made apparent when the IMD failed to forecast 2009's record-breaking drought.\nOn the other hand, the 3D modeling technique is quick and reliable, but demands immense computing power.\nMeteorologist M. Rajeevan, who heads the country's weather office, told Reuters that the new supercomputer will work ten times faster than the one used in recent years. With this speed and efficiency, India hopes to better predict the weather patterns that provide its farmers with most of their rainfall while helping those in rural regions prepare for drought.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you summarize the importance of monsoons in Indian agriculture and the country's current method for predicting them?"}
{"prompt": "Can you tell me more about how the 3D modeling technique is different from the statistical method that India currently uses for predicting monsoons?"}

Over four hundred members of the alumni came to attend the meet from various parts of the country. Organised by the MSRIT Alumni Association (MSRITAA), the meet was inaugurated by Tallam Venkatesh, president of MSRITAA and YA Prahlad Rao and B Krishnappa, who are former principals of the college. It was a day of nostalgia and catching up for the alumni, some of whom had also brought their wife and children along. The day-long affair had a host of activities lined up for the ex-students, who not only devoured the buffet but enjoyed challenging each other to games of badminton, billiard, chess and carom among other things. After this, SY Kulkarni, principal, MSRIT, thanked the contributions of all donors and urged them to continue supporting the college in whatever way they could. “For a change, we wanted an outing for the entire family so that they could also meet the teachers and friends. We’ve always had the alumni meets on campus but we wanted to give more freedom to the ex-students this time and everybody welcomed the break from the routine. Given the number of people who showed up, it was quite a success. It wasn’t really nostalgic but a dream come true. What we’ll do next time is to share the dates in advance so that more people can plan it out as a family holiday,” shared Tallam Venkatesh."}

{"prompt": "Given the text: Shame and guilt are both similar feelings but what is the difference? “Although many people use these two words interchangeably, from a psychological perspective, they actually refer to different experiences. Guilt and shame sometimes go hand in hand; the same action may give rise to feelings of both shame and guilt, where the former reflects how we feel about ourselves and the latter involves awareness that our actions have injured someone else. In other words, shame relates to self, guilt to others” (Burgo). Both shame and guilt play a major role in Nathanial Hawthorn’s The Scarlet Letter.
